Accordingly, the allocation of sustainability officers and sustainability teams to develop and implement a sustainability strategy is vital for businesses that wish to remain competitive.\u00a0\nYet, such imminent pressure for businesses to place sustainability at the forefront of their strategy comes with an array of barriers which may vary depending on the region, industry and organisation. As such, this article provides\u00a0 a comprehensive guide to developing and implementing a decarbonisation strategy for 2024, whilst denoting the most common barriers to the implementation of decarbonisation agendas, and how sustainability teams can overcome the key obstacles that arise within the implementation of decarbonisation strategies.\nWhat is a decarbonisation strategy?\nDecarbonisation refers to the removal or reduction of all human-made carbon emissions into the atmosphere.\u00a0\nThe implementation of a decarbonisation strategy involves organisations leveraging cross-cutting measures to reduce or eliminate carbon emissions from their business activities, and across their wider supply chain. In doing so, businesses can positively impact the planet in their contribution to universally recognised climate goals, whilst leveraging an array of strategic opportunities and mitigating vast financial and non-financial sustainability risks.\u00a0\nDecarbonisation differs from climate neutrality because it seeks to reduce absolute carbon emissions and intensity. Meanwhile, climate neutrality does not necessarily include decarbonisation actions, as climate neutrality can be achieved through solely buying carbon credits.\u00a0\n\u200d Learn more about what decarbonisation means for companies here.\nWhy should companies implement a decarbonisation strategy?\nDecarbonisation is a global imperative for governments, businesses and society because it plays a crucial role in mitigating climate change. While many companies declared becoming carbon-neutral by 2050, recent estimates by the United Nations (UN) suggest we are not on track to meet the Paris targets - more must be achieved, and at a greater speed.\nBeyond positively impacting our planet, decarbonisation strategies enable businesses to unlock a wide range of strategic opportunities , such as:\n- Decreased internal costs due to increased energy efficiency.\n- Decreased internal costs due to less waste\n- Decreased internal costs due to greater supply chain efficiency\n- Decreased time and costs relating to emissions calculations\u00a0\n- Greater stakeholder trust\u00a0\n- Greater employee satisfaction, retention, and engagement.\n- Increase in brand value\u00a0\n- Enhanced competitiveness\nMeanwhile, businesses that join the movement towards net zero will mitigate several key risks , including:\n- Decreased employee engagement due to a lack of commitment to sustainability\u00a0\n- Decrease in sales due to damaged consumer perception\n- Greater internal costs due to unnecessary waste\n- Greater external costs due to carbon taxes\u00a0\n- Fines and administrative costs due to not complying with policies or regulations.\u00a0\n- Increased risks and costs leading to decreased competitiveness\nWhat are the barriers to implementing a decarbonisation strategy?\nInability to communicate the business value of sustainability\nTo reap the long-term benefits of sustainability, the business value of sustainability must be communicated to key stakeholders and decision-makers across the businesses\u2019 wider supply chain. As a general rule, sustainability messaging must be considered within every aspect of organisational communications and decision-making processes. Companies can achieve this by ensuring that employees are actively involved in the net-zero journey, and that there is clear and open communication with stakeholders surrounding the role of sustainability within the overall company strategy, and the business benefits of a value-chain-wide commitment to sustainability. In doing so, businesses will create value via enhanced investment returns and long-term asset optimisation. Plan A has provided a comprehensive guide to communicating with stakeholders in the net-zero transition .\nLack of clarity on how to tie sustainability to company purpose\u00a0\nBusiness leaders and teams that do not understand the connection between the company\u2019s purpose and sustainability will be unable to achieve true sustainability success. Business leaders must define their mission by gaining clarity on the purpose of the company beyond profit maximisation and analysing how sustainability aligns with the company\u2019s overall mission. Clarifying this purpose can be achieved through tasks such as setting sustainability targets and integrating sustainability into the organisation\u2019s performance evaluation. Understanding how sustainability ties into the company\u2019s core values and objectives allows businesses to drive meaningful change, whilst ensuring that sustainability is placed at the forefront of their strategy.\nMisalignment in organisational structure\nA key barrier to the successful implementation of a decarbonisation strategy is misalignment within a company\u2019s organisational structure. Whilst there is no \u2018secret formula\u2019 to executing an effective sustainability strategy; the leadership structure utilised is a paramount factor as it dictates reporting lines, cross-functional management and partnerships, thus reflecting how executive leaders value sustainability progress. Ensuring alignment in a company\u2019s organisational structure also ensures that key decision-makers are informed about the requirements to meet the company\u2019s climate goals.\nTo enact a structure that informs decisions and builds accountability within management, a cross-functional approach which seeks to align all components of a business is vital. As such, for a company or organisation to ensure that sustainability is at the core of their business - appointing a Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) to oversee the development, implementation and management of a sustainability strategy is highly recommended.\u00a0\nLack of public policy\nAnother central barrier to the implementation of an effective sustainability strategy is a weak regulatory landscape. ESG regulations provide clear guidelines for sustainable practice, thus ensuring that businesses are informed of the requirements they must meet to avoid sanctions, what actions they should take to embed sustainable practices, and therefore how businesses can allocate their resources to positively contribute to the global journey towards net-zero. Accordingly, voluntary corporate action is not enough to meet universal climate commitments - such as shifting the world to a 1.5\u02daC pathway. These commitments can only be met if government action is forthcoming via the implementation of clear ESG policies and regulations. Learn more about the importance of ESG regulations in facilitating business climate action here .\nLack of understanding of current sustainability performance\nA key barrier sustainability teams face when attempting to implement a successful decarbonisation agenda is not understanding the company\u2019s sustainability stance, along with their future sustainability needs. To overcome this barrier, sustainability leaders must take action to ensure that organisation-wide and value-chain-wide sustainability assessments are periodically undertaken. Businesses that ensure that sustainability performance data is rigorously measured and analysed will be able to identify, and take action, upon the requirements to meet their sustainability goals .\u00a0\u00a0\nLack of decarbonisation targets\nCompanies that do not set clear, science-based decarbonisation targets will ultimately forgo the ability to implement an effective decarbonisation strategy. Companies who set reduction targets for their company and value chain via the utilisation of expert guidance will be able to ascertain a deep understanding of the different decarbonisation pathways and reduction levers that they can leverage to achieve net zero. Furthermore, companies which set clear net-zero targets will ultimately score higher on ESG reporting and improve their brand reputation; with 79% of corporate executives surveyed by the SBTi finding a strengthened brand reputation following the implementation of science-based targets.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, a survey of business executives in the APAC region found that 60% of companies in the region had not set decarbonisation targets and those that had faced a range of obstacles to meeting them. As such, utilising comprehensive sustainability software will allow companies to receive expert advice and guidance on target-setting, along with the actions required to meet decarbonisation targets.\u00a0\u00a0\u200d\nLack of clarity regarding how to get started, and which technologies to use\nLast but not least, sustainability decision-makers are often overwhelmed when it comes to choosing the most effective strategies and technologies necessary for decarbonisation. To overcome this barrier to decarbonisation success, it is highly recommended that companies evaluate the opportunities associated with using sustainability software, such as a comprehensive carbon accounting and decarbonisation platform , to assist in the development of a dynamic and innovative decarbonisation strategy.\u00a0\nBest practices for implementing a decarbonisation strategy\nCollect:\nCollecting emissions data is a necessary first step to your net-zero journey. The data collection phase is defined by sourcing data required for carbon accounting and ESG reporting, which means coordinating data from various departments and stakeholders. This can include everything from employee commute information, building electricity use, and the weight of waste produced in your business office.\u00a0\nMeasure\nNow that your organisation has collected its carbon and ESG data, it is time to measure your corporate carbon footprint - which ultimately acts as the prerequisite to your sustainability journey. Measuring greenhouse gas emissions is defined by calculating all relevant emissions across scopes 1, 2 and 3. This step is crucial, as this calculation will define the baseline year you will compare all your reduction efforts. Bringing awareness to the total corporate carbon footprint and value chain emissions of a business enables all efforts of energy savings, cost savings, and overall environmental impact reductions to commence.\nSet targets\nSetting decarbonisation targets is a critical aspect of any climate or decarbonisation strategy. Companies must align their specific greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets with the globally agreed 1.5\u00b0C limit, as outlined by the Paris Agreement. To set these targets, companies need to collect and analyse data for at least one year to establish their \u2018baseline year of emissions\u2019. Having an emissions baseline is essential for setting science-based targets. According to the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) , over 2,253 companies have committed to setting science-based targets as of 2022. Setting company-wide decarbonisation targets is a complex process, necessitating a thorough understanding of various decarbonisation pathways and target-setting options. This process also involves engaging and persuading a range of stakeholders to ensure their support for implementing changes during the subsequent stages of emissions reduction.\nReduce\nClimate actions speak louder than words. It is not enough to make pledges, it is important to act on your climate targets and demonstrate your commitment to your shareholders, stakeholders and the outside world. Reducing emissions is about translating climate targets and net-zero pledges into concrete actions. Making pledges is not enough so it is important to act on decarbonisation targets to demonstrate a credible sustainable commitment to your shareholders, stakeholders and the rest of the world. Accordingly, businesses must prioritise the following to ensure emissions are reduced efficiently and effectively:\n- Understand your emissions hotspots\n- Secure budget and internal support\n- Secure staff resources and guidance\n- Identify and implement decarbonisation levers\n- Avoid the belief that offsetting all carbon emissions is needed to reach net zero\n- Avoid a \u2018one-size-fits-all\u2019 strategy\nReport\nSustainability reporting and climate risk disclosure are defined by converting measured emissions or ESG questionnaire results into a communicable format that is compliant with legislations, regulations, or frameworks that companies need to report on. Sustainability reporting is no longer a \u2018nice-to-have\u2019, and is now an essential practice that provides stakeholders with valuable information on a company\u2019s environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. As corporations embark on their decarbonisation journey, transparency and communication are crucial elements; thus, reporting must be made a central focus.\n\u200d Read more on the 6 key steps to ESG reporting here.\nImprove\nAs companies embark on their decarbonisation journey, it is crucial they continuously evaluate and refine their sustainability strategy in order to improve . This entails assessing the effectiveness of implemented carbon reduction measures and making data-driven decisions to deepen decarbonisation efforts. With an array of digital, material, and decarbonisation technologies available, it is vital to develop a plan that enables large-scale impact while maximising value. Engaging and involving stakeholders, investors, employees, and the broader ecosystem is crucial for the continuous improvement of your sustainability strategy.\nUse decarbonisation software\nUtilising cutting-edge tools and technologies is fundamental to implementing a comprehensive decarbonisation strategy, whilst overcoming the array of barriers that individuals, teams and businesses face when implementing sustainability strategies. Plan A hosts a data-driven SaaS platform that is underpinned by the latest scientific standards and methodologies (T\u00dcV Rheinland certified and GHG Protocol compliant). The software automates CO2 emissions calculation, and carbon reduction planning, as well as regulation and audit-proof ESG reporting, empowering businesses to seamlessly manage their entire net-zero journey.\u00a0\nLevel-up on sustainability using Plan\u00a0A's leading decarbonisation platform.\nSustainability leaders must utilise leading tools when attempting to implement a decarbonisation strategy and overcoming the aforementioned decarbonisation barriers. As a first step, organisations should assess their current stance on sustainability, which will enable them to develop a clear strategy. Next, sustainability leaders should use sustainability software from leading experts, such as Plan A. Their decarbonisation solution allows companies to collect and streamline emissions data, measure and analyse scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions , and report on sustainability and ESG performance to ensure businesses can reap the long-term benefits of a decarbonisation strategy.\u00a0\nLooking to future-proof your business via decarbonisation?

Scope 2 emissions are generated from purchased energy - from a utility provider. In other words, all GHG emissions released in the atmosphere, from the consumption of purchased electricity, steam, heat and cooling.\nBack to Glossary\nTable of contents\nh2\nWhat are emissions \u2018scopes\u2019?\nh2\nWhat are Scope 2 emissions?\nh2\nHow does Scope 2 vary from business to business?\nh2\nHow do Scope 2 differ from Scope 1 and Scope 3 emissions?\nh2\nWhy should businesses measure and reduce scope 2 emissions?\nh2\nReporting on scope 2 emissions\nh2\nBest options to reduce Scope 2 emissions\nh2\nUse a software to manage your scope 2 emissions\nScope 2 emissions are a scope that businesses can take clear, immediate action upon to ultimately reduce their overall carbon footprint. Therefore, understanding where Scope 2 emissions originate and how Scope 2 emissions can be reduced is fundamental to accelerating the decarbonisation journey.\nWhat are emissions \u2018scopes\u2019?\nBefore we dive into Scope 2 emissions, it is crucial to gain a clear understanding of what we mean by \u2018scopes\u2019. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol ( GHG Protocol ) categorises business greenhouse gas emissions as Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions , which define where within the wider supply chain certain emissions occur. This framework for carbon accounting helps businesses organise the activities that produce greenhouse gases emissions (GHG) into manageable categories across their corporate value chain. Furthermore, such guidelines were created to give businesses a framework to accurately measure, track, and reduce their emissions. Accordingly, the graph below explains the various three scopes and their emissions sources:\nScopes 1, 2 & 3 emissions explained.\nCredit: Plan A based on the GHG Protocol\nWhat are Scope 2 emissions?\nScope 2 emissions are owned, indirect emissions that arise from the generation of purchased energy from a utility provider. In other words, Scope 2 contains all GHG emissions released in the atmosphere from the consumption of purchased electricity, steam, heat and cooling. Scope 2 emissions are categorised under the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, which is widely recognised as the leading framework for carbon accounting.\nHow does Scope 2 vary from business to business?\nElectricity will be the unique source of Scope 2 emissions for most businesses. Put simply, the energy consumed falls into two scopes. Scope 2 covers the electricity consumed by the end-user; while Scope 3 covers the energy used by the utilities during transmission and distribution, also known as \u2018T&D losses\u2019. Meanwhile, the production and distribution of electricity purchased from the utility or supplier impacts a businesses Scope 2 emissions. If a business's electricity mix is heavily-reliant on fossil fuels, their Scope 2 emissions will ultimately be higher than electricity produced by\u00a0 renewable electricity, biomass, or natural gases.\u00a0\nThe GHG Protocol provides extensive Scope 2 guidance - highlighting that categorising Scope 2 emissions from purchased energy can be ambiguous for organisations using leased spaces. Accordingly, businesses must ensure they are aware of the type of lease they are operating under, and ensure they take a control approach to carbon accounting that is aligned with the GHG Protocol\u2019s guidance on leased assets. For example, any purchased electricity, steam, heat, and cooling falls under Scope 2 on a capital lease, regardless of whether it\u2019s by the building owner or manager.\u00a0\nHow do Scope 2 differ from Scope 1 and Scope 3 emissions?\n- Scope 2 emissions are owned, indirect emissions. Scope 2 emissions are generated from purchased energy - from a utility provider. In other words, all GHG emissions released in the atmosphere, from the consumption of purchased electricity, steam, heat and cooling.\n- Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions from company-owned and controlled resources across four categories - stationary combustion, mobile combustion, fugitive emissions and process emissions,\n- Scope 3 emissions are not owned, indirect emissions that are not included in Scope 2. These emissions occur in the value chain of the reporting company and include both upstream and downstream emissions. In other words, emissions are linked to the company's operations. According to GHG protocol , Scope 3 emissions are separated into 15 categories.\nPlan A's sustainability experts have crafted comprehensive guides to Scope 1 & Scope 3 emissions:\n- What are Scope 1 emissions?\n- What are Scope 3 emissions?\nWhy should businesses measure and reduce scope 2 emissions?\nIf your business or organisation purchases electricity, district heating or cooling, or steam for industrial processes - Scope 2 emissions will inevitably be created, which must be accounted for in the business\u2019 GHG inventory. However, businesses must not let this intimidate them as there are clear financial and non-financial advantages to measuring and reducing their Scope 2 emissions. Businesses who collect data, track, measure and reduce their emissions will ultimately be able to reduce inefficiencies, ensure compliance with sustainability rules and regulations , avoid carbon taxes, and boost their value to internal and external stakeholders.\u00a0\nSpecifically, businesses that measure and reduce their Scope 2 emissions will ultimately be able to leverage the following opportunities:\u00a0\n- Increased energy efficiency: Businesses that prioritise sustainability through tracking and measuring their Scope 2 emissions will be able to identify areas with excessive energy usage and waste. The identification of such bottlenecks via technology such as sustainability software allows businesses to implement actions, such as switching electricity providers, to drastically reduce their energy consumption, water usage and waste; thus significantly reducing their internal costs. \u200d\n- Improved employee satisfaction, retention, and engagement: As employees increasingly place value upon sustainability, ensuring that businesses tracking and reducing emissions is a strategic focus is critical to reaping the benefits of improved employee attraction, satisfaction, retention and engagement. Businesses that implemented a comprehensive sustainability strategy were found by Verizon to achieve up to a 13% increase in employee productivity.\n- \u200d Increased stakeholder trust: Measuring Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions is the backbone of any comprehensive sustainability strategy. Meanwhile, Harvard Business Review found that for a 15-year period, sustainability programs on average have increased shareholder value by $1.28 billion. As such, developing and implementing a comprehensive sustainability strategy is a fundamental step for any business looking to leverage the strategic opportunity of increased trust among internal and external stakeholders.\nNevertheless, businesses that measure and reduce their Scope 2 emissions will ultimately be able to mitigate an array of risks, including:\n- Increased external costs due to carbon taxes: Carbon taxes pose a significant\u00a0 financial risk to carbon-emitting businesses - with carbon prices rising from $10.53 per metric ton in 2018 to more than $95 in February 2022. Therefore, businesses who wish to mitigate the risk of external carbon costs must monitor their emissions data and implement practices to reduce their emissions across all three scopes via actions such as switching energy providers to increase energy efficiency, or reduce fossil fuel dependence. \u200d\n- Fines and administrative costs due to non-compliance with ESG regulations: Businesses that do not prioritise the measurement, reduction and reporting of all three emissions scopes expose themselves to immense non-compliance risk. The financial consequences of non-compliance with sustainability and ESG regulations can be severe, with OECD findings stating that fines and penalties, on average, cost $2 million. As such, businesses must ensure they are up-to-date with the latest ESG, sustainability and reporting requirements to mitigate the harmful risks of non-compliance.\n- \u200d Decreased revenue due to a loss of sales: Consumers are increasingly prioritising sustainability when making purchasing decisions. Nielsen studies show that 72% of consumers stated they were actively buying more environmentally friendly products than they did five years ago, while 81% stated they expected to buy even more over the next five years. As such, businesses that do not prioritise Scope 1, 2 & 3 emission reduction expose themselves to the risk of misalignment with consumer values, and therefore a decrease in sales revenue.\nReporting on scope 2 emissions\nReporting on Scope 2 emissions is a fundamental step within the sustainability journey of any business wishing to ensure compliance with sustainability regulations, or reap the long-term strategic opportunities associated with sustainability. Businesses that report on Scope 2 are able to assess their indirect carbon footprint associated with energy consumption and thereby make efforts to reduce their impact. Reporting on these emissions is a crucial component of many forthcoming corporate sustainability regulations , and is fundamental to enabling companies to measure and manage their environmental impact related to energy use.\nBusinesses must ensure that they report on Scope 2 in line with the GHG Protocol\u2019s Scope 2 Guidance; a recent amendment to the GHG Protocol\u2019s Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. Sustainability experts such as Plan A are GHG Protocol compliant; and are therefore able to provide much needed clarity on how corporations measure emissions from electricity and other types of energy purchases. This heightened level of transparency plays a crucial role in the corporate sustainability journey.\nBest options to reduce Scope 2 emissions\nNearly 40% of global greenhouse gas emissions can be traced to energy generation , and half of that energy is used by industrial or commercial entities. Subsequently, Scope 2 emissions reduction is a critical step within the inevitable sustainable transformation of the global economy.\nThe first step for businesses looking to take climate action is to collect data and measure emissions . Once businesses start calculating their carbon emissions, they can set decarbonisation targets and reduce their Scope 2 emissions. To reduce these emissions reach reduction targets, businesses can implement reduction actions such as:\n- Conserving energy (e.g. implementing energy conservation policies within the office).\n- Energy-efficiency upgrades (e.g.switching to LEDs and better insulation)\n- Switching to a low-carbon electricity provider (e.g via on-site installations or through changing the energy products purchased (suppliers/contracts)).\u00a0\n- Engaging with stakeholders (e.g. communicating the benefits of renewable energy to the building owner)\nUse a software to manage your scope 2 emissions\nA SAP Insights survey found that under one-third of mid-market executives are completely satisfied with the quality of data at their disposal to drive sustainable transformation. Simultaneously, the survey reported that 86% of organisations still use spreadsheets to measure emissions data. While businesses are caught-up using such inefficient processes, an increasing number of businesses are leveraging the power of carbon accounting software to maximise the accuracy and reliability of data, along with the overall efficiency of carbon accounting and sustainability strategy management.\nBusinesses can intuitively manage their Scopes 1, 2 & 3 emissions using the Plan A\u00a0dashboard.\n\u200d Plan A is the industry leading provider of corporate carbon accounting, decarbonisation, and ESG reporting software.

Businesses, policymakers, and environmentalists alike are focusing on Scope 3, diving deeper into what it is and why it's vital. In this guide, we break down the concept of Scope 3 emissions, its categories, how it relates to Scope 1 and 2, and the importance for companies (regardless of their industry, size and locations in which they operate) to actively measure and reduce Scope 3 emissions.\u00a0\nWhat are Scope 3 emissions?\nScope 3 emissions, commonly referred to as \u2018value chain emissions,\u2019 encompass all indirect emissions that occur in a company's value chain, excluding those from Scope 1 and 2. These emissions arise from sources not owned or directly controlled by the reporting organisation but are related to its activities, such as business travel, employee commuting, and third-party distribution. As defined by the GHG Protocol Standard Scope 3 emissions are divided into 15 categories.\nScope 1, 2, 3 according to the GHG\u00a0Protocol.\nCredit: Plan A\nHow do Scope 3 emissions impact a company's overall carbon footprint?\u00a0\nScope 3 emissions constitute the lion's share of a company's overall carbon footprint, with some assessments indicating they can account for up to 90% of the total greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) . Given their vast origins, these emissions paint a comprehensive image of a business's environmental footprint, encompassing the full spectrum of its value chain.\u00a0\nRecent studies have highlighted the profound impact of the supply chain on these emissions, revealing they are, on average, an astonishing 1 1.4 times higher than operational emissions \u2014a figure more than double previous estimates. This increase is attributed to suppliers refining their emission accounting protocols.\u00a0\nIn today's business climate, addressing emissions throughout the entire value chain, including Scope 3, is rapidly becoming the norm. Yet, realising this ambition necessitates robust engagement at all levels of the supply chain. The impending environmental risks in supply chains signal significant economic implications. Suppliers project these risks could culminate in a financial setback of US$1.26 trillion over the next five years. Should these costs be transferred to corporate buyers, the additional expenditure could reach approximately US$120 billion.\u00a0\nComplying with the GHG Protocol has been pivotal in this shift, empowering companies to both measure and influence their suppliers' climate commitments. Yet, challenges persist. While transparency rises, action, particularly in cascading environmental initiatives down the supply chain, is lacking. More companies must inspire leadership in their supplier networks, ushering in a cascade of positive environmental action\u2014a key ingredient for a resilient and thriving global economy.\u00a0\nWhat are upstream and downstream emissions from Scope 3?\nAccording to the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain Accounting and Reporting Standard , Scope 3 emissions are segmented into two main groups: upstream and downstream activities. The 15 categories of emissions under Scope 3 can be classified based on their alignment with these two groups. Understanding these categories can help businesses pinpoint where the most significant emissions occur in their value chain and tailor their mitigation strategies effectively.\nUpstream emissions\nUpstream emissions encompass all the greenhouse gas emissions produced before the products or raw materials arrive at the company's doorstep . This often includes emissions from the extraction of raw materials, their subsequent production and processing, and the transportation of these materials to the company.\u00a0\nExamples of upstream activities:\n- Extraction and production: Mining activities for metals like iron or aluminium produce significant amounts of GHG emissions due to the energy-intensive processes and machinery involved.\n- Agricultural activities: Growing crops like soy or cotton can generate emissions from the use of fertilisers, machinery, and land conversion.\n- Transport : Shipping raw materials globally, whether by sea, air, or road, leads to emissions due to fuel combustion. For instance, transporting crude oil from extraction sites to refineries can lead to significant CO 2 emissions.\nDownstream emissions\nDownstream emissions refer to those GHGs emitted after the company's services/product has been sold and are typically associated with the end use, disposal, and treatment of these products/services once their life cycle is complete.\nExamples of downstream activities:\n- Service/product usage: Consumer electronics, like smartphones, have emissions associated with their use. Charging these devices or using data centres and networks to support their functions contributes to downstream emissions.\n- End-of-life treatment: Discarding products such as plastics can lead to emissions if they're not recycled or are improperly disposed of, especially if they end up in landfills where they produce methane as they decompose.\n- Transport and distribution: Emissions can also be generated when products are transported from retailers to consumers. This includes, for example, the delivery trucks of e-commerce platforms transporting goods to the end customers.\nIn conclusion, by delineating between upstream and downstream emissions, companies can get a holistic view of their environmental footprint across the entire value chain. By focusing on high-emission areas, they can make more informed decisions on where to implement carbon reduction strategies.\nWhat are the 15 emissions categories of Scope 3?\nAs established previously, the 15 categories within Scope 3 emissions encompass both upstream and downstream activities. To facilitate understanding, these categories are broken down as follows:\nUpstream activities\n1. Purchased goods and services relate to the extraction, production, and transportation of goods and services a company buys. In simpler terms, emissions from making and moving products and services the company acquires.\n2. Capital goods relate to the extraction, production, and transportation of capital goods purchased or acquired by the reporting company in the reporting year. In other words, emissions from the creation and transport of big company purchases, like machinery.\u00a0\n3. Fuel and energy-related activities (not included in Scope 1 or 2) correspond to emissions from:\u00a0\n- Making and moving fuels used by the company.\u00a0\n- Producing the electricity the company buys.\u00a0\n- Power loss in transmitting that electricity.\n4. Upstream transportation and distribution involves transportation and distribution of products among suppliers and the company. Simply put emissions from moving goods between the company and its suppliers.\n5. Waste generated in operations relates to waste sent to landfills and wastewater treatments. Waste disposal emits methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), which cause greater damage than CO 2 emissions. Ir refers to the disposal and treatment of waste created by the company. In simpler terms, emissions arise from handling and disposing of the company's waste.\n6. Business travel centres on employee travels for work using non-company vehicles (e.g. planes, trains, cars). Essentially, emissions from company-related travel, excluding company-owned modes of transport.\n7. Employee commuting concerns the daily travel of employees between their homes and workplaces. Simply, emissions from staff's daily commutes.\n8. Upstream leased assets refer to emissions from assets the company leases but don't count in its direct emissions. In simpler terms, emissions from using assets the company rents but doesn't own.\nDownstream activities\n9. Downstream transportation and distribution pertains to the movement and storage of products the reporting company sells in the reporting year. This includes the journey between the company's operations and the end consumer when not financed by the company, as well as retail and storage in vehicles and facilities that the company doesn't own or control. In simpler terms, emissions from moving and storing the company's products in places and by methods not directly owned by the company.\n10. Processing of sold products refers to the transformation of the company's sold intermediate products for end-use. In other words, emissions when the company's products are processed or altered before final use.\n11. The use of sold products concerns the emissions when consumers use the company's products. Simply, emissions from end-users using the company's products.\n12. End-of-life treatment of sold products refers to emissions from the disposal or recycling of the company's sold products. In simpler terms, emissions are when the company's products are discarded or recycled.\n13. Downstream leased assets are assets the company rents to others and their associated emissions. Essentially, emissions from assets that the company leases out.\n14. Franchises refers to the operations of franchises in the reporting year, which don't fall under the direct emissions categories of Scope 1 and Scope 2. Essentially, emissions from business activities at franchised outlets that function under the company's brand but are not directly managed by the company.\n15. Investments pertain to the functioning of investments in the reporting year, encompassing equity, debt investments, and project finance, which are not covered in Scope 1 or Scope 2 emissions. In simpler terms, emissions are linked to the company's financial investments in other businesses or projects.\nHow does Scope 3 differ from Scope 1 and 2?\nScope 1 emissions are direct emissions coming from sources owned or controlled by the company, such as burning fossil fuels or company vehicles. Scope 2 emissions are indirect and arise from the consumption of purchased electricity, steam, or other energy sources. While Scope 1 and 2 are more about the organisation's direct actions, Scope 3 revolves around the entire value chain.\nWhy measure Scope 3 emissions?\nScope 3 emissions, encapsulating a company's entire value chain, stand as a pivotal component of a comprehensive carbon footprint analysis. Measuring these emissions offers an expansive lens through which a company can truly fathom its environmental influence. This measurement is not just a mere nod to sustainability, it's an actionable insight into the intricate web of operations, relationships, and practices that shape a business. Here's why measuring Scope 3 emissions is integral:\n1. Holistic environmental understanding: Evaluating Scope 3 emissions provides businesses with a bird's-eye view of their entire environmental impact. From the extraction of raw materials to the end-of-life disposal of products, companies can gauge the breadth and depth of their carbon footprint.\n2. Identification of emission hotspots : It highlights significant emission sources, enabling businesses to pinpoint areas that need urgent attention and intervention. Whether it's in the procurement of raw materials or the distribution of final products, having this knowledge equips companies to strategise effectively.\n3. Risk and opportunity assessment: By understanding their value chain emissions, businesses can foresee potential risks\u2014be they regulatory, reputational, or operational. Conversely, they can also spot opportunities, such as the potential for innovative low-carbon products or operational efficiencies that can reduce costs.\n4. Credibility and transparency in reporting : As stakeholders, including investors and consumers, increasingly demand transparency, measuring and reporting on Scope 3 emissions can bolster a company's credibility. It signals a genuine commitment to sustainability and an acknowledgement of the company's role in the larger environmental ecosystem.\n5. Engaging value chain partners: Understanding Scope 3 emissions provides a framework for businesses to engage with their suppliers and partners more proactively. It can lead to collaborative efforts in GHG management and sustainability initiatives, fostering stronger, more aligned relationships.\n6. Driving strategic business objectives : Beyond the evident environmental benefits, measuring Scope 3 emissions aligns with core business objectives. By identifying GHG reduction opportunities, setting targets, and tracking performance, companies can unearth potential cost savings. Public reporting, in turn, can enhance corporate reputation, furthering stakeholder trust and potentially opening doors to new business opportunities or partnerships.\nIn essence, the endeavour to measure Scope 3 emissions, while rooted in environmental consciousness, is deeply interwoven with a company's strategic vision, operational efficacy, and stakeholder relationships. In an increasingly eco-aware global market, this measurement is not just a nicety\u2014it's a business necessity.\nIs it mandatory to calculate and report on Scope 3 emissions?\nWhile Scope 1 and 2 reporting are mandatory for many companies under specific regulations, Scope 3 reporting remains largely voluntary . However, as stakeholder demand for transparency increases, many organisations are choosing to report on Scope 3 emissions to provide a comprehensive carbon footprint view. Also, companies succeeding in measuring and reporting all three scopes will get a substantial competitive advantage.\u00a0\nHow to set decarbonisation targets for Scope 3 emissions?\nSupply chain emissions have become the focal point of decarbonisation strategies. Scope 3 emissions are significantly higher than direct emissions, being on average 11.4 times larger . To mitigate global emissions and accelerate the transition to a net-zero economy, businesses must aggressively decarbonise their entire supply chain.\nThe Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) offers a comprehensive framework for companies aiming to set ambitious and meaningful decarbonisation goals. Here\u2019s a deep dive into the methodology proposed by the SBTi:\nSupplier engagement targets\nSupplier engagement targets serve as one of the four methods companies can use to create Scope 3 targets. Essentially, these targets stipulate the segment of a company's emissions that will be addressed by their suppliers establishing science-based emission reduction goals soon. An illustrative example is: \u2018Company X commits that 85% of suppliers by spend, encompassing purchased goods and services as well as the use of sold products, will set science-based targets by FY 2024.\u2019\nTo align with SBTi's criteria:\n- Companies must set Scope 3 targets, encompassing supplier engagement targets or reduction goals, which cumulatively cover a minimum of 67% of their total Scope 3 emissions .\n- These targets become imperative if Scope 3 emissions exceed 40% of a company's combined total of Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions.\nEngaging supply chains on the decarbonisation journey\nThe effort and resources required to initiate a supplier engagement program can be extensive. However, tracking progress might be relatively straightforward once these targets are set. To fulfil a supplier engagement goal, companies should actively collaborate with their suppliers to ensure their targets comply with SBTi's criteria.\nThis engagement process is designed to create a virtuous cycle. The more entities in the supply chain that act on climate change, the more data becomes accessible. This rich data pool facilitates the formation of precise targets and effective reduction strategies, simplifying the path for others to set similar objectives.\nSelecting the right suppliers for the right target\nAddressing emissions from the supply chain paves the way for robust supplier engagement. This process can significantly enhance efficiency, transparency, and resilience throughout the value chain. As stakeholders like investors, customers, and employees intensify their demand for corporate responsibility, focusing on supply chain emissions can boost credibility.\nCompanies are faced with the daunting task of halving emissions by 2030 and achieving net-zero before 2050. To accomplish this, proactive engagement with supply chain actors is paramount. This means nurturing a supply chain that\u2019s not only resilient to climate impacts but is also proactive in setting science-based targets.\nThe SBTi guide serves as a foundational resource for businesses collaborating with their suppliers to systematically address supply chain emissions. Moreover,\u00a0\nCalculating Scope 3 emissions\nBefore embarking on the journey of setting supply chain emission reduction targets, companies must conduct a thorough Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory, adhering to the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard.\nValue chain mapping: This entails a meticulous review of every Scope 3 category as outlined in the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard. Companies need to pinpoint all upstream and downstream activities pertinent to each category.\nScope 3 screening: This phase involves an initial estimation of emissions across all Scope 3 categories. This helps determine the most significant categories, identify the best reduction opportunities, and align them with the company\u2019s objectives. The typical method employed for this is the Environmentally Extended Input-Output (EEIO) conversion based on procurement spend data. However, other techniques such as industry averages can also be utilised.\nThe GHG protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Standard\nThe GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Standard provides a standardised framework for companies to measure and report their Scope 3 emissions. It offers guidelines on data collection, calculation methodologies, and reporting practices to ensure accuracy and consistency in Scope 3 emissions reporting.\nWhy reduce Scope 3 emissions?\nReducing Scope 3 emissions is integral for a sustainable future. It not only contributes to a healthier environment but also:\n- Enhances brand reputation and stakeholder trust\n- Mitigates supply chain risks\n- Opens up potential for innovation and new market opportunities\n- Demonstrates corporate responsibility and commitment to sustainability\nUse carbon accounting software to manage your Scope 3 emissions\nScope 3 emissions, given their expansive nature covering the entire value chain, present unique challenges to companies aiming for comprehensive carbon accountability. Traditional methods, like manual spreadsheets, can be cumbersome, error-prone, and might not adequately capture the intricacies of Scope 3 emissions data.\nThe transformational shift in the business landscape now revolves around digital solutions.

In other words, they are emissions released into the atmosphere directly resulting from a set of activities.\nBack to Glossary\nTable of contents\nh2\nWhat are emissions \u2018scopes\u2019?\nh2\nWhat are Scope 1 emissions?\nh3\nStationary combustion\nh3\nMobile combustion\nh3\nFugitive emissions\nh3\nProcess emissions\u200d\nh2\nHow does Scope 1 vary from business to business?\nh2\nHow do Scope 1 differ from Scope 2 and 3 emissions?\nh2\nWhy should businesses measure and reduce scope 1 emissions?\nh3\nEnergy efficiency and waste reduction\nh3\nCompliance with ESG regulations\nh3\nImproved employee satisfaction, retention, and engagement\nh3\nIncreased stakeholder trust\nh3\nIncrease in brand value\nh3\nEnhanced competitiveness\nh2\nBest options to reduce Scope 1 emissions\nh2\nUse a software to manage your scope 1 emissions\nAlthough Scope 1 often accounts for the smallest amount of greenhouse gas emissions a company emits, it is also the scope most directly under a business\u2019s control . Understanding where Scope 1 emissions originate can offer a clear starting point for decarbonisation.\u00a0\nWhat are emissions \u2018scopes\u2019?\nBefore we dive more deeply into Scope 1, it is important to understand what we mean by scopes. In 2001, the GHG Protocol \u2019s guidelines categorised business greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions. These scopes define where within the wider supply chain that emissions occur. Meanwhile, the guidelines were created to give businesses a framework to measure, track, and reduce their emissions.\u00a0The graph below explains the various three scopes and their respective emissions sources:\nScopes 1, 2 & 3 emissions.\nCredit: Plan A based on the GHG Protocol\nWhat are Scope 1 emissions?\nScope 1 emissions are direct emissions from company-owned and controlled resources. In other words, they are emissions that are released into the atmosphere on-site as a direct result of a set of activities at a firm level.\u00a0\nAccording to the GHG Protocol, Scope 1 emissions consist of the following four categories:\nStationary combustion\nStationary combustion covers emissions released from the direct burning of fossil fuels to power heat sources (e.g. a gas-powered water heater) or stationary combustion engines .\nMobile combustion\nMobile combustion covers emissions released from all vehicles owned or controlled by a firm (e.g. cars, vans, trucks). However, only vehicles running on fossil fuels (gas or diesel) fall under Scope 1. The increasing use of \u201celectric\u201d vehicles (EVs) means that some of the organisation\u2019s fleets could fall into Scope 2 emissions.\nFugitive emissions\nFugitive emissions are leaks from greenhouse gases (e.g. refrigeration, air conditioning units). It is important to note that refrigerant gases can be anywhere from one hundred to ten thousand times more dangerous than CO 2 emissions. Companies are strongly encouraged to report these emissions.\u00a0\nProcess emissions \u200d\nProcess emissions are those released during industrial processes and on-site manufacturing (e.g. production of CO 2 during cement manufacturing, factory fumes, chemicals).\nWhether a business\u2019 Scope 1 emissions reflect a small or large portion of their total corporate carbon footprint (CCF) , taking action to reduce such emissions plays a significant role in reducing harmful emissions associated with refrigeration, air conditioning, fire suppression and industrial gases. These emissions are often composed of synthetic gases with greenhouse warming potentials much higher than carbon dioxide .\u00a0\nHow does Scope 1 vary from business to business?\nNot all Scope 1 emissions are equal, as different companies have different operational emissions. For the majority of companies, decarbonising across Scope 1 will mean ensuring their office space is energy efficient, is well insulated, and heating and cooling valves and pipes are not leaking and are in optimal condition. It could also mean transitioning from fossil fuel to an electric vehicle fleet. For such companies, the majority of emissions are happening in their Scope 3 emissions, which can often account for over 90% of greenhouse gas emissions .\u00a0\nHowever, for some companies, the majority of their emissions are indeed Scope 1. For instance, a manufacturing company within the building or material transformation sector that\u00a0is producing steel will be producing most of its emissions on-site. For these kinds of businesses, Scope 1 decarbonisation will require innovation, new technologies, and a deep commitment to new ways of doing business.\u00a0\nHow do Scope 1 differ from Scope 2 and 3 emissions?\nWhile Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions from company-owned and controlled resources across four categories - stationary combustion, mobile combustion, fugitive emissions and process emissions, Scopes 2 and 3 consist of emissions created across the wider business value chain.\u00a0\nScope 2 emissions are owned, indirect emissions . Scope 2 emissions generated from purchased energy - from a utility provider. In other words, all GHG emissions released in the atmosphere, from the consumption of purchased electricity, steam, heat and cooling.\nScope 3 are not owned, indirect emissions that are not included in Scope 2 . These emissions occur in the value chain of the reporting company and include both upstream and downstream emissions. In other words, emissions are linked to the company's operations. According to GHG protocol , Scope 3 emissions are separated into 15 categories.\nFor a comprehensive guide to scopes 1, 2 & 3 emissions, read here.\nWhy should businesses measure and reduce scope 1 emissions?\nThere are clear financial and non-financial advantages to measuring and reducing Scope 1 emissions. Not only are businesses save money by reducing inefficiencies, but also are able to ensure compliance with new sustainability rules and regulations , avoid immense costs associated with carbon taxes , and appear more attractive to internal and external stakeholders, employees, and consumers.\u00a0\nMore specifically, businesses who measure and reduce Scope 1 emissions are able to achieve the following.\nEnergy efficiency and waste reduction\n\u200d Organisations that prioritise sustainability through tracking and measuring their carbon emissions will be able to identify areas with excessive energy usage and waste. The identification of such bottlenecks via technology such as sustainability software allows businesses to implement actions to drastically reduce their energy consumption, water usage and waste; thus significantly reducing their internal costs.\nCompliance with ESG regulations\n\u200d Businesses that do not prioritise sustainability expose themselves to immense non-compliance risk. The financial consequences of non-compliance with sustainability and ESG regulations can be severe, with OECD findings stating that fines and penalties, on average, cost $2 million. As such, businesses must ensure they are up-to-date with the latest ESG, sustainability and reporting requirements to mitigate the harmful risks of non-compliance.\nImproved employee satisfaction, retention, and engagement\n\u200d In line with the increased value that employees are placing upon sustainability, ensuring that sustainability is a strategic focus is key to reaping the benefits of improved employee attraction, satisfaction, retention and engagement. Businesses that implemented a sustainability strategy were found to achieve an increase in employee satisfaction, productivity, retention and engagement, with Verizon research finding up to a 13% increase in employee productivity .\nIncreased stakeholder trust\n\u200d Harvard Business Review found that for a 15-year period, sustainability programs on average have increased shareholder value by $1.28 billion. As such, prioritising sustainability is a fundamental step for any business looking to leverage the opportunity of increased trust among internal and external stakeholders.\nIncrease in brand value\n\u200d The implementation of effective ESG & sustainability programs was found by Nielsen to have enabled companies to see up to a 60% increase in customer commitment . Meanwhile, sustainable product sales have grown four times more than conventional product growth since 2014. Therefore, as consumers are increasingly looking to support sustainable businesses, making sustainability a strategic priority is vital for businesses wishing to see an increase in brand value.\u00a0\nEnhanced competitiveness\n\u200d MDPI research found that acting on corporate sustainability holds\u00a0a positive correlation with long-term financial performance and ROI. Sustainability is vital for businesses wishing to reap the long-term financial and non-financial benefits associated with enhanced competitiveness.\nBest options to reduce Scope 1 emissions\nScope 1 is the first place to look when seeking out decarbonisation strategies. The solutions tend to be in-house and there are usually clear and well-defined changes that companies can make to reduce emissions. Scope 1 is also the scope most under a business\u2019s control and therefore, understanding it can offer a clear start to decarbonisation. As such, when committing to sustainability, Scope 1 is a natural starting place for many businesses.\nThe most exciting aspect of Scope 1 is that companies can take immediate and tangible actions today to lower this set of emissions. Why? Because, unlike Scope 3 emissions that fall either up or downstream along the supply chain, the actions needed to decarbonise Scope 1 fall within the jurisdiction of the company itself , and the solutions tend to be in-house and there are usually clear and well-defined changes that companies can make to reduce emissions. Therefore, lowering Scope 1 is immediately actionable and creates an immediate impact. Scope 1 is the first place businesses focus on when seeking out decarbonisation strategies .\nThe three key tenets for reducing Scope 1 emissions include:\n- Optimise : Whether it is manufacturing or a service sector, optimising the amount of fuel consumed to get work done reduces emissions substantially. Depending on the type of Industry, the reduction potential is at least 20% .\u00a0\n- Electrify : Replacing traditional fossil fuels by electrifying them enables us to reduce Scope 1 emissions completely.\n- Decarbonise : Shifting to 100% renewable energy for all operations reduces emissions in purchased electricity.\nSome specific ways to lower Scope 1 emissions could include:\n- Switching to energy-efficient appliances\n- Turning down the thermostat in winter\n- Insulating your office\n- Proper maintenance of your gas heater or heat pump\u00a0\n- Switching the company fleet from combustion engine vehicles to electric vehicles\n- Checking AC and refrigeration units for leaky valves or pipes\n- Replacing inefficient appliances\nScope 1 emission is often the first set of emissions a company uses to measure, reduce and report greenhouse gas emissions on. This is because businesses have full oversight and control over emission sources, as everyday decisions within a business can impact Scope 1.\nPlan A has powerful decarbonisation tools to measure, track and reduce your emissions across scopes 1, 2 and 3.

Plan A , Europe\u2019s leading corporate carbon accounting, decarbonisation, and ESG reporting software provider, has closed a $27M funding round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners. Visa, with whom Plan A signed an exclusive global partnership in December 2022 ( see press release here ), has also joined the round, along with Deutsche Bank, Opera Tech Ventures (VC arm of BNP Paribas), and a large number of unicorn founders, including those of Supercell, Aiven, Zalando, and Wolt.\nPlan A just raised $27M to achieve its mission to decarbonise businesses worldwide.\nCredit: Plan A\nAll existing investors such as HV Capital, Keen Venture Partners, Demeter IM, and coparion have also participated. Plan A was able to secure the investment as it has demonstrated significant growth in customer base (1,500+ clients) and software revenues (>600% YoY Dec 2021\u201322), a pan-European partnership network, and a market-leading climate data processing and business decarbonisation technology.\nThe funding now heralds the next growth phase. With the fresh capital, Plan A will double its headcount to 240+ employees to expand its market penetration in Europe with a strong focus on France, the UK, and Scandinavia, as well as deepen its platform capabilities. For the latter, the aim is to further advance its platform's decarbonisation tooling, Scope 3 coverage and actionability, as well as policy alignment capabilities. With this, Plan A will further its mission to empower hundreds of thousands of businesses to self-manage their net-zero journey by using its end-to-end SaaS platform.\nPlan A Sustainability Platform: Science-based SaaS covers entire decarbonisation journey\nBy automatically mapping all necessary data across Scopes 1, 2, and 3 and merging them with national emission factors and datasets, the Plan A Sustainability Platform is able to provide granular emissions profiles and ESG insights in dynamic dashboard overviews. Based on the indicators with the most significant reduction potential, the software empowers companies to set science-based net-zero targets and achieve them through 1,000+ decarbonisation solutions and activities, best practices, as well as a network of service providers and sustainability professionals. At the end of this holistic process, the platform produces regulation-proof ESG reporting. Due to the high degree of automation, deep decarbonisation and compliance in a highly fragmented regulatory market becomes manageable, less complex, and cost efficient.\nOverview of the emissions dashboard of Plan A Sustainability Platform.\nCredit: Plan A\nTo meet the highest scientific standards, all platform-embedded calculations and decarbonisation solutions are fully aligned with internationally recognised scientific methodologies and standards such as the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). The scientific accurateness of the applied Corporate Carbon Footprint (CCF) calculation methodology is certified by T\u00dcV Rheinland, one of the world's leading verification bodies.\nLubomila Jordanova, CEO of Plan A: \u201cClimate change and the associated impacts pose an existential risk to businesses. It's our mission at Plan A to provide made-to-measure software solutions and services to empower large and complex companies to decarbonise their operations and value chains and respond to the regulatory shift. We are over the moon to bring these stellar investors onboard the Plan A journey today to back us in navigating the complexity of corporate decarbonisation and address climate change on a global scale.\u201d\nJulie Kainz, Partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners: \u201cAt Lightspeed, we strongly believe in the power of technology and unique founding teams to attack one of the most important challenges our society faces today - climate change. We\u2019ve been closely following the journey of Lubomila and the entire Plan A team over the past years and it has become incredibly clear to us that they have positioned themselves as a leader in this space. The strength and flexibility of their platform truly has the capabilities to drive change and impact within organisations from across any sector and on a global scale, and to guide organisations both small and large on a holistic decarbonisation journey.\u201d\nPlease find high-res images here and use them by indicating the copyrights.\nAbout Lightspeed Venture Partners\n\u200d Lightspeed is a multi-stage venture capital firm focused on accelerating disruptive innovations in the enterprise, consumer, fintech, and health sectors.

As we inch closer to that deadline, it becomes evident that achieving these targets requires the collaboration of every sector, with the business world playing a pivotal role in the sustainable transition.\u00a0\nWithin this spectrum, the Human Resources (HR) and recruitment industry, valued at a whopping $762 billion and employing over 10.4 million individuals globally, emerges as a major influencer on global GHG emissions. The future of work will depend on HR\u2019s active involvement in sustainability for several reasons. This article explores the responsibilities and benefits of sustainability for HR leaders.\u00a0\nThe role of Human Resources (HR)\u00a0in sustainability\nYou may wonder, why HR? Historically, HR was the go-to for recruitment, training, and personnel management. However, the dynamics have evolved. Today's HR leaders are not just custodians of talent but also ambassadors of organisational culture while fostering change, diversity and inclusion. They have the unprecedented task of weaving sustainability into the fabric of a company's ethos, from hiring to policy-making.\u00a0\nSuch integration doesn't only serve an ethical or environmental purpose but also aligns with tangible commercial benefits:\n- Talent dynamics: Research from Deloitte underscores that significant proportions of Gen Z and Millennial workers factor in organisational commitment to sustainability when deciding job longevity. 40% of respondents have reported that they have already changed jobs due to climate concerns, or that they plan to change jobs because of climate concerns.Catering to this sentiment ensures leadership stability and streamlines recruitment.\n- Thus, Gen Zs and millennials continue to demand greater climate action from their employers and believe some have deprioritised sustainability strategies in recent years. They also see a critical role for employers to provide the necessary skills training to prepare the workforce for the transition to a low-carbon economy.\u00a0\u200d\n- Consumer behaviour: A shift was observed between 2021 and 2022, with an 8% increase in consumers willing to pay a premium for sustainable products. With 88% reviewing sustainability credentials before a purchase, sustainable businesses have a competitive advantage.\u00a0\u200d\n- Stakeholder perspective: Ignoring sustainability could translate into legal and profitability challenges. Conversely, businesses incorporating decarbonisation into their ethos find favour with stakeholders, enjoying consistent profits.\nGiven the prevailing trends, HR's pivotal role in guiding businesses toward sustainable practices cannot be overstated. They are instrumental in shaping the present workforce and charting the future course of enterprises.\nWhat is green HR?\nGreen HR, a term introduced by Walter Wehrmeyer, refers to HR policies focused on preserving natural resources. The primary objective of green HR is to promote environmental consciousness and contribute to an organisation's socio-economic well-being.\u00a0\nGreen HR\u2019s benefits include:\u00a0\n- Spreading green values across the employee base.\n- Instilling eco-friendly behaviour.\u00a0\n- Enhancing commitment to sustainability.\u00a0\n- Amplifying the company's positive public image.\u00a0\n- Attracting potential job seekers.\nStrategic benefits and challenges of embracing sustainability in HR\nBenefits of sustainability integration for HR\n- Talent acquisition and retention : Sustainable HR practices are more than just an attractive proposition\u2014they act as a magnet for top-tier talent. Implementing these practices reduces recruitment costs, fosters increased loyalty and responds to the modern workforce's discerning preferences. A 2021 Gallup poll underscored this, revealing that 70% of US workers take into account a company's environmental footprint when considering job opportunities.\n- \u200d Consumer trust and brand loyalty: The contemporary consumer market is astutely aware and informed. Brands that visibly prioritise sustainability win not only consumer trust but also loyalty, paving the way for enhanced market positioning and competitiveness. \u200d\n- Financial resilience: While transitioning to sustainable practices may require an initial investment, the long-term financial returns are undeniable. These returns come not only in the form of positive growth but also in the avoidance of potential pitfalls like regulatory fines and the loss of trust from both consumers and potential employees. In fact, the World Economic Forum's research found that companies with a robust sustainability strategy can expect an average annual growth rate of 15%.\nChallenges and risks\nThe pressing demand for sustainability from both consumers and the workforce presents challenges for companies that are slow to adapt. Recruitment agencies, in particular, are now tasked with showcasing sustainable values, not just in their external offerings, but in their internal policies and practices. This transformation isn't just about attracting top talent\u2014it's about avoiding significant financial repercussions. To emphasise the stakes, a study showed that incidents related to ESG concerns can cause an average market capitalisation loss of 6% .\u00a0\nFuture opportunities for HR in sustainability\nCompanies that proactively weave sustainability into the fabric of their HR and recruitment processes are poised to harness a wealth of opportunities. Aside from the direct financial advantages and enhanced operational performance, there's a broader impact at play. HR departments, backed by sustainable practices, have the chance to shape the very essence of modern workplaces, guide the trajectory of businesses, and contribute to meaningful, lasting changes in the fight against environmental degradation.\u00a0\nIn this evolving landscape, the narrative is clear: sustainability isn't just an ethical choice\u2014it's a strategic imperative.\nHow to incorporate sustainability into HR & recruitment processes\u00a0\nDriving sustainability is not just about the big picture; it\u2019s also about the granular, day-to-day operations. Here are ways HR and recruitment can make a difference:\u00a0\n- Embed sustainability in your core values : Position sustainability as a central part of your mission, values, and brand. Make it evident across all company communications.\u00a0\n- Engage with candidates about their environmental passions and ensure alignment with the company's goals.\u00a0\n- Embrace digitalisation : Harness the power of virtual hiring, cloud-based systems, and digital documentation. Such steps not only save resources but also massively reduce the carbon footprint through lowered travel and minimised paper use.\u00a0\n- Cultivate climate consciousness : Training hiring managers to emphasise the company's green initiatives can be pivotal. Candidates should not only be informed but also feel like they can be part of the company's green journey.\u00a0\n- Avoid greenwashing : While it's essential to advertise your eco-friendly initiatives, authenticity is vital. Avoid misleading or exaggerated environmental claims.\u00a0\nThe shift towards sustainability is not a fleeting trend\u2014it's the future. HR and recruitment sectors stand at a crossroads where every decision can catalyse lasting change. Embracing this responsibility can ensure that businesses thrive economically while championing planetary well-being.

However, while many companies understand that corporate social responsibility (CSR) is an ethical imperative; many businesses are yet to unlock the wide-ranging benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) . As such, many businesses are missing out on the immense value that the implementation of a decarbonisation strategy unlocks when looking to secure large business deals.\u00a0\nNevertheless, as the global economy undergoes a rapid transition towards a low-carbon state, sustainability will fundamentally reshape the landscape for B2B companies. Global businesses that take action to transition towards net-zero carbon emissions will be exposed to wide-ranging growth opportunities, whilst companies that do not take action will take on immense financial and non-financial risk.\u00a0\nThe role of sustainability within B2B relationships\u00a0\nAs companies embark on their sustainability journey, they are required to set net-zero targets whilst implementing sustainable actions, such as reducing waste, greenhouse gas emissions, fossil fuels, energy and water consumption. In doing so, they are increasingly recognising the imperative role that their suppliers and partners play in achieving these goals and making a long-lasting impact.\u00a0\nSuppliers & partners:\nFor the majority of large entities, as much as 95% of their supply chain consists of a broad list of vendors. Despite many of these partners being small and midsize companies, they still hold the potential to hold an immense impact on the overall sustainability and performance of the entire supply chain. Suppliers that take action to ensure decarbonisation, circularity, sustainable distribution, and fair labour practices are key strategic priorities will unlock a newfound level of transparency, and therefore desirability, to existing and prospective business partners that are undergoing sustainable transformation.\u00a0\nBusinesses are increasingly prioritising sustainability within every aspect of their supply chain in order to achieve set targets and reduce their scope 3 emissions . Consequently, large corporations are placing transparency around sustainability as a critical factor when dealing with suppliers, vendors and external firms; with many large corporations using requests-for-proposals (RFPs) so that prospective partners can provide proof of sustainable practices. For instance, Landsec has a stringent tender process whereby an RFP document is issued to prospective suppliers and requires full responses to a suite of sustainability questions in line with their sustainability requirements. Suppliers must supply information specific to the goods and services being procured, such as details of emissions performance of a supplier's vehicle fleet. Furthermore, once Landsec appoints business partners, they must then report against specific key performance indicators on a quarterly basis.\nThis means businesses - irrespective of their size or industry - will ultimately be left no other choice than to implement an aligned sustainability strategy if they wish to secure lucrative business opportunities. Meanwhile, carbon is money; and with new EU regulations such as the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) coming into play - not acting on carbon emissions will increase costs in the long run due to increased regulations and carbon taxes.\u00a0\nInvestors: \u200d\nInvestors play a crucial role in the growth and development of businesses. In parallel to the critical role that sustainability plays within the decision-making processes of corporate boards, investors are progressively directing capital towards sectors and companies based on their sustainability and ESG strategy. Oxford University found that 80% of mainstream investors now consider environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria when making investment decisions. Correspondingly, businesses that don\u2019t prioritise sustainability inevitably risk misalignment with the ever-so sustainable demands of investors, and thus the wide-ranging financial opportunities associated with external investment.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, research shows that sustainable and low-carbon products perform better than those of peers on capital markets; achieving greater shareholder returns, profit margins and growth. Nevertheless, businesses must whilst ensuring clear, open and consistent communication to internal and external stakeholders when integrating sustainability as a key focus within their overall strategy. In doing so, businesses will create value via enhanced investment returns and allow for long-term investment and asset optimisation .\nThe wider business benefits of sustainability\nOrganisations, especially those operating within a B2B environment, that are not proactive in taking measures to bolster their stance on sustainability will ultimately be exposed to immense financial, competitive and regulatory risks. Meanwhile, economists are predicting \u2018catastrophic outcomes\u2019 for businesses should they fail to take proactive action against climate change before it\u2019s too late and businesses that do not take sustainable action will ultimately miss vital business opportunities and deals \u2013 forgoing growth, and expansion.\u00a0\nHowever, business leaders have the opportunity to leverage the benefits of sustainability to effectively align their long-term strategy with the sustainable demands of stakeholders. Taking advantage of ESG and sustainability will be fundamental to reaping the vast financial and non financial benefits associated with sustainability, allowing businesses to become attractive prospects to both existing and prospective parties. A few of the strategic opportunities associated with sustainability include:\n- Stakeholder trust \u200d\nMost importantly, implementing an aligned sustainability strategy is critical to unlocking enhanced business opportunities due to the key role that sustainability plays in building trust among internal and external stakeholders. Over a 15-year period, sustainability programs on average have increased shareholder value by $1.28 billion . As such, a fundamental step for any company looking to secure business deals is making sustainability a key focal point within their wider business strategy due to the vast business opportunities associated with increasing trust among stakeholders, such as receiving external investment.\u00a0\n- Brand value\nThe implementation of effective ESG & sustainability programs has enabled companies to see up to a 60% increase in customer commitment. Meanwhile, sustainable product sales have grown four times more than conventional product growth since 2014 . As society exponentially looks to support sustainable businesses, making sustainability a strategic priority is vital for businesses wishing to unlock enhanced value, and thus wider business opportunities.\u00a0\n- Supply chain\u00a0\nBusinesses that prioritise sustainability across their wider supply chain will be able to not only reduce their own scope 1 and 2 (direct) emissions, but also ensure that they are not negatively impacting the overall emissions of their partners. As more-and-more businesses look towards partnering with sustainable businesses to reduce their scope 3 (indirect) emissions; businesses that undergo sustainable transformation, via practices such as engaging with sustainable suppliers, will improve the overall efficiency of their own, and partner's supply chain. Consequently, they will ultimately be able to significantly reduce their internal costs; with findings highlighting up to a 60% potential improvement in operating profits through supply chain optimisation .\u00a0\n- Energy efficiency and waste reduction\nOrganisations that prioritise sustainability through tracking and measuring their carbon emissions will be able to identify areas with excessive energy usage and waste. The identification of such bottlenecks via technology such as sustainability software allows businesses to implement actions to drastically reduce their energy consumption, water usage and waste; thus significantly reducing their internal costs. Through vast improvements in financial performance, businesses will drastically increase their attractiveness to prospects such as vendors, suppliers, partners and investors.\n- Competitive advantage\nStudies show that acting on sustainability holds a positive correlation with long-term financial performance and ROI; thus making sustainability fundamental to businesses wishing to reap long-term financial and non-financial benefits. Businesses that implement an aligned sustainability strategy will not only ascertain a competitive advantage, but also meet key sustainability key performance indicators (KPIS); thus ensuring that they are perceived as highly desirable to prospective business partners.\u00a0\nHow can businesses implement sustainability to secure large business deals?\nGiven that there is no \u2018one-size-fits-all\u2019 approach to sustainability; many enterprises often do not share the same goals or approaches. Therefore, companies must ensure they are flexible to adapt to a wide range of requirements, such as KPI\u2019s, reporting formats and communication channels; thus ensuring they are able to easily adapt to the dynamic requirements of other business\u2019 sustainability strategies.\u00a0\nBusinesses who wish to secure vital business opportunities will therefore need to implement a comprehensive sustainability strategy. This involves calculating the business\u2019 scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions , setting science-based targets, developing decarbonisation pathways, and gradually moving towards long-term carbon capture, storage, and sequestration for any emissions which cannot be reduced. Meanwhile; two key areas that businesses must prioritise when undergoing green transition include:\u00a0\n\u200d Undertaking a data-driven approach to drive meaningful change\nAt the forefront of driving sustainable transition is becoming data-driven. Prioritising data collection, measurement and tracking is fundamental to adapt to the ever-changing needs of the wider business landscape and thus becoming an attractive prospect to other businesses. According to an SAP Insights survey , less than one-third of mid market executives are completely satisfied with the quality of data at their disposal to drive sustainability transformation. Meanwhile, it was reported that 86% of organisations still use spreadsheets to measure emissions data.\nIn order to ensure that businesses can flexibly adapt to the sustainability requirements of their existing or prospective associates, businesses must therefore take a data-driven approach whilst focussing on sustainability metrics, current and anticipated future regulatory compliance needs, and embedding sustainability at the forefront of corporate strategy. By focusing on those requirements, organisations can leverage their data to holistically measure, manage, and optimise environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance in ways to ensure that they are attractive prospects to current and future partners.\u00a0\nSustainability officers and departmental leaders can collaborate whilst utilising a data-driven sustainability software to bulk upload data from various departments and stakeholders, and measure their total corporate carbon footprint and value chain emissions; thus drawing deep insights and enabling energy savings, cost savings, and overall environmental impact reductions.\n\u200d Pursuing alignment with reporting standards\nFollowing third-party ESG reporting standards and frameworks is a key step that should be taken to ensure accuracy and efficiency within reporting processes; thus ensuring accuracy and transparency.\u00a0 Frameworks, such as those developed by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board ( SASB ) and the Global Reporting Initiative ( GRI ), provide fundamental guidance on reporting material across a range of industries. As reported by CDP, there has been a 24% jump in companies asking their suppliers for environmental transparency; including companies such as Nike, Airbus, Sainsbury\u2019s and \u00d8rsted. These standards utilise robust and systematic disclosure processes that assist in making reports more accurate and comparable, thus increasing the value of these reports to the internal and external stakeholders of companies, and ensuring businesses are able to generate more business.\u00a0\n\u200d\nA guide to the top reporting frameworks which companies must consider in order to become an attractive prospect within the business landscape. Credit: Plan A\nUltimately, business leaders who wish to secure lucrative business opportunities will soon have no other choice than implementing a comprehensive sustainability strategy. Businesses that adopt an aligned decarbonisation strategy; through calculating scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, setting science-based targets, developing decarbonisation pathways, and gradually moving towards long-term carbon capture, storage, and sequestration for any emissions which cannot be reduced, will be exposed to wide-ranging growth opportunities, whilst companies that do not take action will take on immense financial and non-financial risk.\u00a0\nSustainability is quickly becoming a must-have for business looking to secure strategic opportunities.

One such crucial test is the materiality assessment, a cornerstone in ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) operations. So, why are materiality assessments becoming indispensable for organisations striving towards sustainability?\nWhat is a materiality assessment?\u00a0\nBy definition, a materiality assessment is a formal exercise aimed at engaging external stakeholders to find out how important Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues are to them. The insights from material assessments can be used to guide strategies and communication and tell a more meaningful sustainable story to stakeholders.\nIn other words, a materiality assessment is a method that allows companies to understand and prioritise their sustainability issues better, incorporating stakeholder views on their products or services. The primary objective of this assessment is to identify the social and environmental areas that hold the most significance for your company, investors, and stakeholders.\u00a0\nWhy is a materiality assessment important?\nMateriality assessment is the bedrock for companies to formulate efficient sustainability strategies . With the world increasingly striving for net-zero emissions , the relevance of this assessment has skyrocketed. It illuminates various ESG challenges that could potentially derail a company's journey towards environmental and economic prosperity.\nResearch reveals that companies that address material ESG factors pertinent to their industry may have a performance advantage over the long term . Simultaneously, there's a potential opportunity cost for businesses emphasising immaterial factors. Although it's not a direct causation, there's a clear correlation between material ESG issues and financial performance, underlining the importance of materiality assessments.\nRegulatory developments such as the SEC disclosure rule in the U.S. and the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) in Europe. Companies adopting materiality assessments now will be better equipped to meet future environmental regulations .\nHow to conduct a materiality assessment?\nMateriality assessment is an essential practice for organisations seeking to identify and manage the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) topics that matter most to their business and stakeholders. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how to carry out this process:\nPHASE 1: Define objectives, scope, and audience\n1. Set clear objectives: Understand what you intend to achieve with the materiality assessment. This may include identifying key ESG risks and opportunities, refining sustainability strategy, or informing wider business strategy, among others.\n2. Identify your audience : Determine who will benefit from the outcomes of your materiality process. It could be the board of directors, sustainability report readers, or others.\n3. Define 'materiality ': Materiality, in this context, refers to the significance of a topic to your stakeholders, its socio-economic or environmental impact, and its strategic relevance to your business.\n4. Outline the organisational scope : Define the regions or business units to be assessed and decide how the outcomes will feed into your reporting, whether it be standalone sustainability reporting or integrated reporting.\nPHASE 2: Identify potential topics\n- Compile a list of material topics : Gather data from multiple sources like media reports, internal data, sector-specific regulations, ratings, and research on wider social and environmental trends.\n- Involve key individuals : Ensure that the list of material topics is compiled in consultation with relevant individuals beyond the sustainability team, like the enterprise risk management team or senior management.\n- Consider external stakeholder engagement :\u00a0 Identify which external stakeholders you should consult for valuable feedback.\nPHASE 3: Categorise\n- Cluster topics into categories : Refine the list of potential material topics by grouping them into relevant categories.\n- Use company-specific language : Align topic names with the existing terminology, strategy, and policies used by your organisation.\n- Ensure understanding : Make sure that everyone involved in the process understands the specific risk or opportunity for each material topic.\nPHASE 4: Gather information\n- Gather relevant information: Collect data about the importance of each material topic to your stakeholders and assess the strategic significance of each topic to the business.\n- Assess impact: Evaluate the actual and potential economic, social, and environmental impacts of each topic.\nPHASE 5: Prioritise\n- Prioritise material topics : Decide which internal stakeholders should be involved in prioritising topics, develop a scoring methodology for each topic, and set a threshold for defining which topics will be considered material.\n- Integrate with risk management: Work closely with enterprise risk management to integrate material social and environmental topics into company-wide risk management.\nPHASE 6: Seek approval\n- Get approval from senior management : Ensure that the materiality assessment is accepted and signed off by senior business management.\u00a0\u200d\n- Present outcomes to the board: Recommend actions for the board based on the outcomes of the materiality assessment.\nPHASE 7: Review and integrate\n- Review with stakeholders: Invite stakeholders to review the material topics published and evaluate the outcome of your materiality assessment before you repeat the process.\n- Document and integrate results: Record results from stakeholder input and describe the impact this will have on future reporting. Also, work towards integrating the results of the materiality assessment into company strategy, governance, operations, and reporting.\nUndertaking a materiality assessment enables organisations to focus their sustainability efforts on the areas that matter most to their business and stakeholders, creating a more impactful and targeted approach to sustainability.\nAt the end of the process, a materiality matrix is often created to provide a visual representation of the key learnings, helping stakeholders decide the next steps based on the findings.\nAdvantages and challenges of materiality assessments\nA materiality assessment provides a wealth of benefits. It enables companies to define a long-term emissions reduction plan, evaluate risks, and take advantage of available opportunities. The process also enhances stakeholder engagement and allows a company to improve its transparency, thereby boosting its reputation.\nMoreover, a materiality assessment can enhance sustainability reporting, facilitate progress tracking, and ensure better resource allocation. A 2021 MIT study found that sustainability reporting can lead to a 4.6% increase in market value , underlining the economic advantages of conducting materiality assessments.\nMateriality assessments, while crucial, are not without their challenges. One of the foremost complexities is the integration and prioritisation of every stakeholder's perspective. In addition to this, a thorough materiality assessment demands scrutiny of a company's full value chain, extending beyond mere operations. Notably, another significant challenge is the substantial amount of time required to conduct a complete Materiality Assessment.\n1- Don't detach the materiality assessment from the core business\nThere can be a tendency to view materiality merely as an obligatory exercise to generate a materiality matrix for your sustainability report. To truly harness the value of your materiality assessment process, it's crucial to go beyond the confines of the sustainability team and engage individuals from all parts of the organisation.\nGuidance: A segregated process has restricted potential for safeguarding and increasing company value.\nThe materiality assessment process can provide you with insights that are too precious to be confined to just the sustainability team \u2013 understanding current and future risks and opportunities should be the foundational step for any sustainable business strategy. Think about broadening the responsibility for the materiality assessment process throughout the organisation as a medium-term goal. In the interim, begin by involving managers from various departments (such as tax, human resources, and sales) through interviews. Gradually, progress to engaging them in monitoring material topics, eventually shifting ownership to them for related topics.\n2- Ensure active involvement from senior management in the materiality assessment process\nGaining senior management's buy-in in the materiality assessment process or making them aware of the results can be a challenge, yet their engagement can substantially enhance the outcome. It can also deter the materiality assessment from being confined to just the sustainability team.\nGuidance: Frame the materiality assessment process in terms of business value.\nWe recommend portraying materiality in terms of its impact on corporate value creation: revenues, cost, and risks. Gradually establish top-tier management engagement, first by involving them in the process from the beginning, via interviews or a workshop, to discuss trends impacting the business. Later, before making the results of your materiality assessment public, obtain an official management-level endorsement on material topics to ensure widespread support for the process and its outcomes.\n3- Conduct a meaningful materiality assessment despite business complexity\nThe GRI\u2019s G4 Guidelines have led many firms to broaden the boundary of their materiality assessment beyond operational control to examine the significance and impact of issues across the value chain, from upstream in the supply chain to downstream product use and disposal. Large multinational corporations face the additional complexity of operating in multiple countries and across distinct business units with vastly different supply chains, products, and customers. Generating a single list of material topics that reflects viewpoints and interests across diverse segments of the business may seem impossible.\nGuidance: Make sure your materiality assessment scope aligns with the realities of your business.\nThere are several ways to dissect a materiality assessment. Ensure your assessment's scope aligns with your business's realities by concentrating on the primary business processes and activities, or the most impactful geographies. Do not attempt to encompass the entire value chain for every business unit in every country initially. Another strategy is to establish a group-level framework for materiality assessment at the corporate centre while identifying material topics at the business unit level. A group-level framework provides consistency in the materiality approach but can be adapted to different operational environments.\n4- Engage stakeholders in a time and cost-efficient manner\nFor large multinational firms, the list of potential stakeholder groups can be extensive, as your business interacts with hundreds of groups each year, both inside and outside the organisation. It can seem like a monumental task to involve these stakeholders in your materiality process to ensure their views and opinions are considered.\nGuidance: Concentrate on your business's current stakeholder interactions.\nStakeholder engagement enhances the quality and credibility of your materiality process. While specific engagement activities can assist you in identifying material issues, a significant amount of valuable input can also be derived from existing sources and engagement channels such as employee or client satisfaction surveys or interviews. Your company's day-to-day stakeholder interactions as part of the regular business are just as valuable as one-off stakeholder activities. Asking external stakeholders to rate the importance of topics to them will provide you useful insights into their concerns and priorities, but don't depend solely on external views to shape your assessment. Also, consider the views of internal stakeholders by asking them to rate and prioritise the importance of topics to the business.\n5- Prioritise topics when stakeholders show interest in every aspect\nYour stakeholders may expect you to treat all opinions equally, but in practice, there are too many views and issues raised by internal and external stakeholders, necessitating some level of prioritisation.\nGuidance: Rank stakeholder views using a straightforward and uncomplicated approach.\nA simple process for weighing different stakeholder views will assist you in refining a long list of material topics into something meaningful that accurately reflects views. One method could be to rank stakeholder views as high, medium, or low against set criteria, such as the stakeholder's ability to significantly impact your business's value creation, the stakeholder representing a large group with a legitimate concern based on the societal impact of the issue, or the ability to reasonably assess the impact of the topic (either quantitatively or qualitatively).\n6- What if material topics are too broad?\nMany firms define material topics in broad terms, sometimes with overlapping subject areas, or fail to define an issue adequately. This makes it hard for stakeholders to determine whether your business is addressing the right issues or not.\nGuidance: Define topics at a level that reflects your organisation and your communication objectives.\nStrive to define material topics at a level that is relevant to your organisation and serves the purpose of your materiality assessment. Avoid combining different levels of topics, e.g. broad topics (environment), with specific sub-topics (improving energy efficiency of products). Different levels of definition could be social and environmental mega forces, topics, sub-topics, and metrics.\u00a0\nWe suggest using different levels to communicate your priorities for different purposes. For instance, in an internal stakeholder engagement workshop, you may receive more meaningful responses to specific sub-topics. When discussing your business strategy with senior management, it may be more relevant to discuss social and environmental changes with implications for the broader business. For an external audience, you might choose to organise information for your sustainability report readers in chapters for each topic. Regardless of the level you choose, consistency is key when communicating your material topics.\nDouble materiality VS single materiality\nDouble materiality is a concept in the field of corporate sustainability that represents two complementary perspectives of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) impacts:\u00a0\nOutside-in or financial materiality: This perspective considers the impacts of external ESG factors on a company's financial performance, business operations, and competitive positioning. These factors can be social, environmental, or regulatory, and their materiality is determined by the extent to which they can affect a company's financial health. For example, changes in climate regulations could pose risks or opportunities for a company, affecting its profitability and sustainability in the long term.\u00a0\nInside-out or impact materiality: This perspective focuses on a company's impact on society and the environment, irrespective of whether these impacts have immediate financial implications. It highlights a company's responsibilities towards stakeholders including employees, communities, customers, and the environment. For instance, a company's waste management practices or community engagement efforts would be evaluated under this perspective, even if these practices do not have an immediate financial impact.\u00a0\nThe principle of 'double materiality' in corporate sustainability reporting, currently a major point of consideration in new European Commission standards, extends the concept of 'single' materiality. Traditionally, single materiality emphasises the impact of sustainability issues on the firm and its prospective future. Double materiality, however, necessitates that companies also disclose their effect on broader systems, like climate, biodiversity, and society.\nThe current situation and future trends of double materiality\nAdmittedly, the adoption of double materiality has been gradual in the US, where the GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) still primarily focus on single (financial) materiality. However, American companies that abide by the GRI will inevitably need to shift towards defining materiality grounded in comprehension of real and potential impacts. This transformative notion will constitute a critical aspect of EU standards, but it has stimulated various conversations about its implementation in other contexts. Presently, the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) does not incorporate double materiality in its international sustainability standards. However, this is likely to change soon due to significant market players pushing the organisation towards its inclusion.\nRegardless of these differing viewpoints, the EU intends to progressively incorporate double materiality starting in 2024, notably through the CSRD and EU Taxonomy . Therefore, the companies under its jurisdiction must initiate data collection from this year onward, in preparation for this shift.\nWhy should your company conduct a materiality assessment?\nWhen properly conducted, a Materiality Assessment can validate a business strategy's efforts to incorporate social and environmental needs. It also provides insights on strategies for long-term sustainability success and reveals the topics most relevant to stakeholders. Moreover, it can help identify neglected sustainability issues and assess a company's standing in an increasingly sustainable society.\nAs per a study by McKinsey, companies that lead in ESG had a valuation premium of up to 20% and showed superior profitability , reinforcing the argument for a Materiality Assessment's worth for any company. As sustainability becomes a mandatory aspect of successful businesses, a Materiality Assessment emerges as a worthy investment.\nThe wrap-up\nMateriality Assessments are a gateway for staying informed, actionable sustainability initiatives for companies. They enable businesses to prioritise, strategise, and communicate their sustainability efforts effectively, thereby playing a pivotal role in an increasingly ESG-driven corporate world. If you're looking to improve your ESG performance and sustainability factors, a Materiality Assessment is an excellent first step in your fight against climate change.\nAt Plan A, we understand the intricacies of Materiality Assessments and the unique challenges and opportunities they present.

The industrial revolution and the rise of a capitalistic society have, in a short period of time, changed our planet and our lives. Overconsumption stands at the foundation of modern society and has brought along climate change and its string of environmental hazards and social issues. \u00a0The intensified rhythm of mass production \"naturally\" requires more natural resources than what the earth carrying capacity \u2013 the so-called \u201cplanetary boundaries\u201d - can provide.\nSuch unsustainable consumption will increase if we keep with our linear \u2018take - make - dispose\u2019 economic models. \u00a0 Overpopulation and growing demand for goods result in mind-boggling volumes of waste as well as air, soil and water pollution with high negative impacts on human and ecosystem health. Although the detrimental effects of this linear consumption cycle are well-known, sustainable production, supply and efficient use of resources also represent global challenges to be tackled.\nThe birth of a circular model\nInnovative production and consumption strategies are still required to reduce human pressure on the environment and drive bike towards global sustainable development goals. In the last decades, a new framework emerged, shaped around thrifty waste and resource management, captured by the concept of circular economy.\nCircular economy holds potential to transform deeply our economy\u2019s structure.\nCredit: UNIDO\n\u200d\nCircular economy holds potential to transform deeply our economy's structure (Credit: UNIDO)[/caption] \u00a0This concept was born with Robert Ayres and his theory on industrial metabolism in 1990. In this economic theory, the ideal state of an industrial system resembles nature the most in that it supports a complete internal cycle of materials with no loss. \u00a0Based on previous theorisations, and advanced by McDonough and Braungart\u2019s \u201ccradle-to-cradle\u201d concept , circular economy is today defined as: \u201c An economic system that aims to keep products, components, and materials at their highest utility and value at all times, distinguishing between technical and biological cycles.\u201d\nThis concept calls for the consideration of the full life-cycle of the product, from the material extraction up to the product \u201cend-of-life\u201d, promoting the notion of waste and resource cycling.The basic idea is easy: create more durable and efficient goods in order to decrease global production and consumption of raw materials, as well as other key natural resources such as water or sand.\nTurning a line into a circle\nA successful transformation requires changes at a local, regional, national and international level, and concerns businesses, customers and society. The European Union has adopted circular economy principles as part of their sustainable development strategies, defining different areas of actions within the EU Action Plan for the Circular Economy . This has given rise to a number of new industries focused on recuperating, scraping, cleaning, reusing old products to make new ones, with the ambition that all waste can one day be a resource.\nBusiness models innovation, new policies formulation, eco-design strategies and knowledge sharing are necessary tools for the transition of businesses and society to a circular economy. This, in turn, incentivises the creation of what specialists call inner loops. This means creating circular circuits within the greater loop of the circular economy.\nSustainable ways to create value\nCircular economy generates value through the entire lifecycle by extending the lifetime of products, allowing them to cycle longer in the economy and recuperating their material basics. In our linear economy, value is created by producing and selling as many products as possible. Instead, for the circular economy concept, most of a good\u2019s value lays in its functionality, which therefore is tried to be maintained even after the use-phase of its lifecycle.The adoption of a circular approach therefore requires innovative business models which create, capture and deliver value based on resource efficiency and extending products\u2019 useful life and closing materials flow cycles. \u00a0\nThese circular strategies require the consideration of circular principles from the very early stages of product design processes. Part of the literature identifies eco-design as an approach to improve the environmental performances of products and decrease resource depletion. \u00a0\nThe different strategies to address circular economy.\nCredit: Cycle Competence Center\nThe different strategies to address circular economy (Credit: Cycle Competence Center)[/caption] \u00a0The transition towards a sustainable value creation can be prompted by the definition of three circular business strategies:narrowing, slowing and closing the loops. These nomenclatures refer to the mechanisms by which resources flow through a system: Narrowing loops.\n\u200d This strategy aims at using fewer resources per product, calling for higher resource efficiency. In other words, \u201cdo more with less\u201d. This is where resource maximisation tactics such as lean manufacturing come into play. Although this question is already widespread in the linear economy, focusing exclusively on narrowing loops disregards other aspects of the circular economy.What about the products' quality or afterlife? \u00a0\n\u200d Slowing resource loops: These tactics work on extending products\u2019 lifetimes to slow down the flow of resources. This includes designing long-life, repairable and manufacturable products. This can mean investing extra resources that would eventually be offset by the longer use-cycle of products.the slowing loops approach includes long-life products design, emphasising design for attachment and trust or durability, and product life extension, focusing onease of maintenance and repair, upgradability or adaptability. \u00a0\n\u200d Closing resource loops: This strategy closes the loop between post-use and production, resulting in a circular flow of resources, from disposal back into the production, avoiding waste in the first place. Recycling is the most prominent example of closing resource loop.Strategies to close material loops comprise the design of recyclable parts and goods (design for a technological cycle and biological cycle, design for dis- and reassembly).\nIntegrating circular principles to product design\nConsidering the recent focus on sustainable development and resource efficiency in the European policy context, eco-design strategies can (and must) help companies comply with new regulations aside from reaching cost-efficiency through recycled material usage.As anticipated, a transition to a more circular and resource-efficient economy happens only where changes are planned on several different levels. Tools like the EU Resource Efficiency Scoreboard were created to identify and report on resource efficiency at every stage of production cycles. \u00a0But why exactly are policies really fundamental in the circular economy transition? \u00a0\nFirst of all, the ultimate objectives of circular economy (material efficiency, sustainable production and consumption, creation of sustainable value) require a set of enabling conditions in ordered to be achieved. \u00a0\nThose are identified by the PESTEL model , widely used in strategic analysis and planning to analyse the feasibility of circular systems. The Political element plays an important role in this model, where national and international policy frameworks are necessary in order to allow a successful transition to a circular economy and catalyse changes at different levels.\nThe PESTEL model of analysis lists the prerequisite conditions to successful circular strategies.\nCredit: Business to you\nThe PESTEL model of analysis lists the prerequisite conditions to successful circular strategies (Credit: Business to you)[/caption] \u00a0Indeed, transition processes involve complex interactions between authorities, actors, value chains and systems of production and consumption which are regulated and defined through administrative, economic and informative instruments. These tools (among which bans, standards, taxes, subsidies, labelling and certifications) can enable, hinder, engage, enforce and encourage stakeholders at all levels. Within the European context, a practical example of resource policy is the \u201cCircular Economy Package\u201d, a crucial turning point of the EU Action Plan for the regulation of circular systems in Europe. \u00a0\nThe absence of aligned regulations brings negative side effects. Conflicting incentives, for example, risk promoting only certain strategies or actors, obstructing balanced solutions. Here is where synergies between policy instruments become a crucial factor to achieve circular solutions. \u00a0The transition to a circular economy holds challenges and opportunities at a community level as well. Innovative business models and policy frameworks can help drive towards sustainable systems, but a new social logic of consumption is equally necessary to change the way we use and consume goods and materials. Many community-based initiatives can encourage citizens to use shareable goods, exchange usable products and learn how to repair goods before they reach their real end-of-life. Sharing and repairing ideas can be great means to foster a circular societal shift at the individual and communal levels, creating economic, social and environmental advantages.\nThe importance of individual action\nHave you checked out which sustainable community-based initiatives your kiez has to offer? \u00a0You might find communal gardens, bicycle kitchens, tools-sharing centres and repair cafes, where to share ideas, use spaces or sign up for workshops on \u201chow to repair goods by your own\u201d.Big or small initiatives come hand in hand with a real understanding of our level of consumption. \u00a0 When our wishes grow beyond the latest smartphone, the newest fast-fashion clothes or fresh-tasty-tropical fruits from the Caribbean, we might change the way we conceive our needs.We might realise we use unnecessary resources, pollute our environment and spend a lot of money! It seems difficult, right? It isn\u2019t, at all. \u00a0\nWe could even (re)fill our piggy banks by repairing our goods or clothes instead of buying new, or by renting idle products we do not use daily. We could decrease the consumption (and consequently production) of many un-used goods by using shared products. And we could finally sustain local agro-activities by buying seasonal fruits and veggies instead of supporting businesses hundreds of thousands of kilometres away.When following a circular logic, individual and communal changes support social cohesion and well-being, as much as in decreasing waste and natural resource usage. \u00a0\nMany countries have already defined their commitments to achieve sustainable development goals by driving more sustainable consumption and production. Many companies worldwide are transitioning to a more circular business model and implementing sustainable solutions. Many people are changing their consumption habits, driven by local initiatives and consciousness about sustainable living. A transition to a more socio-environmental conscious, resource-efficient and zero-waste economy is possible when all actors and stakeholders from different levels are involved. \u00a0How about you, what will you change first? \u00a0\nAbout the author: Beatrice Meo is a Master graduate in Environmental, Social and Economic Sustainability from the Institute of Environmental Science and Technology (ICTA) at the Autonomous University of Barcelona. Her main study focus is on climate change and social values on coastal areas. Her final master thesis aimed to analyze the social dimension of climate change impacts on natural protected areas to advance values-based adaptation policies. Her work was part of the LITOMED project led by the INTERFASE research group at UAB. Among the various topics she came across during her studies, she developed a strong curiosity towards climate change research and indigenous knowledge.Besides this, she is currently focusing on sustainable lifestyle practices and interested in the study of circular systems management. She strongly believes the survival of our planet requires a re-thinking of our economic system, with a change in our production and consumption approaches to minimize the burden on natural resources.\nRead more\nBilan Carbone: Your complete guide\nCorporate Sustainability\nDecarbonisation strategy: The comprehensive guide for 2024\nCorporate Sustainability\nDecarbonisation strategy for SMEs: Top 10 low-hanging fruits for immediate impact\nCorporate Sustainability\nThe Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)\nPolicy & Regulations\n6 key steps to ESG reporting\nPolicy & Regulations\n10 Principles to End Greenwashing\nCorporate Sustainability\nGet your company on the path to net-zero\nBook a call with our sustainability experts\nGet in touch", "source": "https://plana.earth/academy/how-can-the-circular-economy-support-sustainable-development", "metadata": {"title": "How can the circular economy support sustainable development?", "content": ["Circular economy", "Sustainable living", "Sustainability"]}}

While the NFRD only provided guidelines for ESG reporting, the CSRD will introduce mandatory reporting standards.\nDownload Policy Factsheet\nBack to Policy Centre\nWhat is the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)?\n- To help improve the flow of money towards sustainable activities across the European Union, the European Commission adopted the ambitious and comprehensive\u00a0Sustainable Finance Package on April 21, 2021 . One of the proposed measures within the package is the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) .\n- The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) has been officially adopted by the European Union Council and entered into force on January 5, 2023 .\n- The CSRD extends the scope and the reporting requirements of the existing Non-Financial Reporting Directive. This regulatory framework mandates sizeable public interest entities report on their sustainability performance since 2018.\n- With its new requirements, the CSRD aims to ensure that businesses report reliable and comparable sustainability information so that investors can re-orient investments towards more sustainable technologies and industries.\nWhich companies have to comply with the CSRD?\n- The CSRD expands the sustainability reporting requirement to a broader range of companies compared to the previous Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) .\n- Whereas the NFRD only applied to companies with more than 500 employees, the CSRD extends to large companies defined as those with over 250 employees and/or \u20ac50M turnover and/or \u20ac25M in total assets.\n- All listed companies (with the exception of micro-enterprises) are now required to report their sustainability performance under the CSRD.\n- The enforcement of the CSRD means that around 50,000 companies across the EU , which account for 75% of all EU companies' turnover, will be required to adhere to detailed EU sustainability reporting standards.\n- Non-European companies that have branches or subsidiaries in the EU, and have a net turnover of \u20ac150M or more within the EU, will also be required to comply with the CSRD, but this requirement will be enforced at a later date.\nDetailed disclosures under the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)\nThe CSRD doesn't only widen the range of businesses required to report on their sustainability\u2014it also heightens the level of disclosure required. In addition to those stipulated by the NFRD, companies must provide detailed reports on:\n- Environmental protection measures : Businesses will have to disclose their specific initiatives to reduce their environmental footprint, including resource conservation and pollution prevention strategies.\n- Social responsibility and treatment of employees : This includes everything from employee health and safety protocols to employee benefits and company culture.\n- Respect for human rights : Companies must discuss their policies on human rights and how they ensure these rights are not violated within their operations.\n- Anti-corruption and bribery measures : Businesses must explain their strategies to prevent corruption and bribery, including corporate governance measures and ethics training programs.\n- Diversity on company boards : The CSRD requires companies to provide a detailed breakdown of the diversity of their board members, focusing on aspects such as gender, age, and nationality.\nBusinesses will also have to start reporting how sustainability risks might affect their performance.\n- While the EU provides voluntary reporting guidelines for NFRD reports, the CSRD introduces more detailed reporting requirements and a requirement to report according to EU sustainability reporting standards.\n- The CSRD reporting will align with the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation and the EU Taxonomy .\u00a0\nTimeline of implementation for the CSRD\nWith the final approval from the European Union Council on 28 November 2022, the CSRD officially entered into force on 5 January 2023. The phased implementation of the directive will occur as follows:\n- End of 2023 : EU Member States will have to adopt the EU Directive into national law.\n- January 1, 2024 : Companies within the scope of CSRD and currently reporting under the NFRD will be obliged to report their FY 2024 data in 2025. As of the beginning of 2024, all other large EU companies within the scope of CSRD are obliged to report.\n- January 1, 2025 : Businesses already subject to the NFRD will have to start reporting in the financial year 2024. \u200d\n- January 1, 2026 : SMEs listed on a regulated market (no micro-enterprises) obliged to report for FY 2025 (but under less stringent reporting requirements).\n- January 1, 2028 : Small and medium enterprises and small and non-complex credit institutions, and captive insurance undertakings will have to start reporting for the financial year 2027 - with a further possibility of voluntary opt-out until 2028. The reporting standards for SMEs will be lighter. \u200d\n- January 1, 2029: Non-European companies that have branches or subsidiaries in the EU with a net turnover of \u20ac150M in the EU will have to start reporting.\nPreparing your business for the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)\nThe implications of the CSRD for businesses are immense, affecting everything from operations to strategic planning. Given the short timeline, it's crucial for companies to start preparing for this new directive. By starting the data collection process early, businesses can ensure they are ready to meet these new requirements when the time comes.\nGiven the comprehensive nature of the CSRD, businesses should consider seeking guidance from policy experts. These experts can provide valuable insights into what the CSRD means for your business and can help you develop an effective strategy for compliance.\nGet a head start on your corporate sustainability journey by aligning your company with the CSRD and taking proactive measures to report on climate risk and sustainability.

Instead of changing companies, why don\u2019t you change your business\u2019 sustainability strategies instead? Green teams are mushrooming in all sorts of businesses and more and more companies are hiring chief sustainability officers.\nDon\u2019t waste your time searching for a new job. Rather, start working towards transforming into a zero-waste company . In a way, working at a not-so-sustainable company is like being on the frontline of climate action, with the possibility to move fast if provided with the right business sustainability strategies and motivation. It can begin today.\nMake your company join the fight (Credit: Plan A)\nHow do you start a sustainable action team?\nStep 1: Prepare your first moves\nFind partners passionate about sustainability in your company. Prepare the first meeting together and get a feel of the room. What kind of climate action is favoured by the majority? What sustainable solutions are most important to the people there? It is important to build corporate sustainability from the ground up.\u00a0\nSet clear outcomes for this first meeting. It is important that people feel things are moving forward in terms of business sustainability strategies. This first meeting should allow you to assign key roles such as a team leader, a treasurer (if you already have a budget) and assess involvement. How many people will be involved and at what levels can they contribute to this sustainability journey? It may also be productive to gauge whether there is interest in hiring a chief sustainability officer for your business if you do not already have one. This meeting should also let people express the reasons why they want to get involved . In our experience, building a climate action plan from the bottom up has a much better chance of survival.\u00a0\nLooking for inspiration? Request to join our community of changemakers\u00a0to access support, ideas and information.\nStep 2: Follow up with action\nBeware of greenwashing Credit: morning brew coffee\nYou have a team, you have an idea, all that is left to do is execute. Go from easy to hard, and don\u2019t set your expectations of sustainable business and a sustainable workplace too high. By now, at least one member of the management team should be in the know and can start providing the institutional support you need to implement these sustainable solutions .\u00a0\nNo need to envision a grand business sustainability strategy to upend the entirety of the company at once. Radical change comes with preparation , gathering momentum, and support. That said, it is important to understand how to avoid greenwashing . Your initiatives become greenwashing only if your desire for climate action dies off before it has had the chance to make a real impact and you do not follow through with your climate action plan.\nSome change is better than no change. When using Plan A , we are committed to making your corporate sustainability journey a prolonged effort that has tangible results at all levels of the company. Consider recommending us to your green team, chief sustainability officer, or general management to help you craft the most effective business sustainability strategy to transform the company from within.\nStep 3: Flexible like a bamboo, strong like an oak\nStart a green team in your company (Credit: You X Ventures)\nKeep growing and fostering a sustainable workplace . Increase your visibility during your first corporate sustainability initiatives by using these recycling posters we\u2019ve designed.\u00a0\nAlthough the final climate action plan of the team should be stated (and written down) from the get-go, a movement needs to leave space for growth. Diversifying sustainable solutions and replacing the initial enthusiasts who have lost momentum are among the difficult decisions that the team leader or chief sustainability officer will have to make. Thankfully, as your group grows and achieves significant, positive, and sustainable change there will be more room to expand and more roles to fill.\u00a0\nAs you begin to positively impact your team and company at large and reduce your corporate carbon footprint, you should see an incremental interest in sustainability. Green teams within companies can usually get some time and some budget to implement their sustainable solutions and grow beyond their usual role. If you need help with specific strategies, send us a message at hi@plana.earth and let\u2019s talk about it!\nThe sustainable ambassador\nFridays For Future (Credit: Markus Spiske)\nWe work to provide you with the tools to create, present and implement sustainable solutions within your company . First, we encourage you to explore our Academy . It\u2019s full of resources to understand the current climate crisis and the case for sustainability. Moreover, we can provide you with deliverables and data to back up your mission \u2013 and make management listen to your argument for exploring and implementing these business sustainability strategies.\nWe have all felt the power of the change environmentalism is going through. We are now millions in the streets fighting against climate change. Let\u2019s translate this mobilisation into tangible climate action by infiltrating the most significant vehicles of carbon emissions, businesses.

With more and more global companies like Spotify, Salesforce, Goldman Sachs and Twitter announcing that their employees could choose to be fully remote forever, we might ask how companies can calculate the carbon footprint of work from home?\nA new calculator developed by Plan A helps\u00a0companies measure and reduce workplace carbon emissions and figure out if working remotely is more sustainable.\nWhat is the environmental impact of work from home?\nThe environmental impact of work from home is more nuanced than it seems. Numerous studies have acclaimed work from home for its environmental benefits while cutting companies' overall carbon footprint: decreasing carbon emissions resulting from commuting to reducing notable office waste. In fact, one\u00a0study\u00a0found that 98% of an employee carbon footprint comes from commuting . Unfortunately, because of the rigidity of conventional working hours, commuters are often stuck in traffic jams accounting for\u00a0millions of tons of wasted greenhouse gases .\nCalculate the carbon footprint of work from home\nIn 2012, pioneer companies like Dell, Xerox and Aetna launched their telecommuting programs to reduce their environmental impact. These pre-pandemic trials had promising results: in 2014, Xerox launched the Virtual Workforce Program , with more than\u00a08,000 Xerox employees (11 per cent of its workforce) working from home full time. Through telecommuting, Xerox reduced greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by 40,894 metric tons , and its remote staff used 4.6 million fewer gallons of gas by not commuting . On the other hand, Dell\u2019s remote work program reduced its GHG emissions by 6,700 metric tons or\u00a0the equivalent of not driving 16 million miles .\nMany characters think that work from home is the best option to reduce carbon emissions, but it is more complex in reality. Remote work displaces carbon emissions from the office to employee's homes. In the U.K.,\u00a0one analysis\u00a0found that remote work has a higher carbon footprint during winter since heating individual homes are less efficient than heating an office. That is why companies need to measure and reduce the carbon footprint of remote work alongside their offices.\nThis calculator tells you what your company's carbon footprint for remote work is.\nPlan A is a Berlin-based startup that offers tools to companies like Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and GANNI to assess their carbon footprint more holistically and decarbonize their activities with reduction plans. Plan A's mission is to \" help companies build a carbon-neutral and sustainable economy \". As telecommuting is part of our daily lives, the company has developed a new work from home feature to help\u00a0companies measure and reduce workplace and remote work's carbon emissions.\n\"While work from home reduces energy consumption and carbon emissions, there will still be induced emissions due to excess energy consumed at home ,\" explains Dr Ramana Gudipudi, decarbonization lead at Plan A. \"Our calculator enables you to calculate that while stating how to find creative ways to reduce these emissions \".\nIs your company taking all the steps to manage its environmental footprint and engage its community with sustainability? We support companies to make the most of their sustainable turn and reduce their emissions rapidly and meaningfully.\nBook a demo today and we\u2019ll get back to you in the next working day on our planet!\nRead more\nBilan Carbone: Your complete guide\nCorporate Sustainability\nDecarbonisation strategy: The comprehensive guide for 2024\nCorporate Sustainability\nDecarbonisation strategy for SMEs: Top 10 low-hanging fruits for immediate impact\nCorporate Sustainability\nNo items found.\nGet your company on the path to net-zero\nBook a call with our sustainability experts\nGet in touch", "source": "https://plana.earth/academy/how-to-measure-carbon-footprint-work-from-home", "metadata": {"title": "How to measure the carbon footprint of work from home?"}}

Since the pandemic outbreak, let's face it, events shifted from in-person to online settings - leaving us facing our screens on Zoom or streaming platforms. A study conducted in April 2020 showed that 50% of companies had to move their events online , but virtual events are meant to stay.\nInternational summits like Davos were being held virtually, music festivals postponed, while the G7 summit was in-person. However, something interesting is happening behind the scenes: most of these new hybrid events claim to be the \" first carbon-neutral events\". For instance, Davos offset the entire event's emissions by protecting a forest , the\u00a0Jacund\u00e1 project\u00a0in the Amazonian \u201cArc of Deforestation\u201d known for its disappearing tropical forest, which protects an area of 95,000 hectares of native forest.\nIt is impossible not to emit CO2 emissions . That is why companies must measure and reduce the environmental impact of their events: virtual, hybrids or in-person ones. Here is the burning question: what is the environmental impact of virtual events, and how to calculate it? Do not panic; Plan A has developed the perfect solution for companies.\nThe environmental impact of virtual events\nFor the past year, virtual events have been praised by media and news outlets for their environmental benefits. Virtual events are said to cut down carbon emissions since there is less travel, waste generated, catering involved, land and water usage. But one expert projected, pre-pandemic, that information and communications technologies could gobble up\u00a020% of global energy demand\u00a0by 2030.\nYou will love to read: What is the difference between carbon-neutral, net-zero and climate positive?\nOn the surface, these claims make sense when looking at the numbers - for example, the famous Coachella music festival is generating 107 tons of solid waste each day , with only 20% of it getting recycled . In theory, if Coachella would have happened online, all this waste would have never existed, reducing the event's carbon footprint - sounds simple right? But the reality is more complex: even though online events have a lower carbon footprint than their physical counterparts, it is still not zero .\nA new study conducted by MIT students showed that one hour of streaming or videoconferencing emits between 150 to 1,000 grams of carbon dioxide , depending on the service. By comparison, a car produces about 8,887 grams from burning 4 litres of gasoline. Another study published in the journal of environmental studies by Grant Faber observed that a one-day virtual conference (on Zoom) with about 200 participants resulted in 1,324 kg of CO 2 emissions , roughly equivalent to driving almost 5311 kilometres burning nearly 680 kg of coal. Of the total, 64% of emissions came from network data transfer, 19% from the pre-conference planning meetings, and 11% from computer use .\nAre you more into Zoom & Networking or Netflix & Chill?\nSource: MIT Energy\nVirtual events still have a considerable environmental impact starting from our increasing internet usage. The electricity needed to power the internet , with its associated carbon, water, and land footprints, isn't the only thing causing havoc on the environment; data transmission and storage also necessitate water to cool the equipment within data centres. Also, the participant computer life cycle emissions and other activities would not have happened without virtual events. Now, you will understand it, calculating virtual event's carbon footprint is a necessity for companies.\nHow to measure the carbon footprint of virtual events?\nNow let's discover the solution. Plan A developed a new feature - a virtual event calculator , part of its carbon management platform. Following the GHG protocol rigorously and using s copes 1,2,3 of carbon emissions , the virtual event calculator collects your data easily and automatically calculates it to give you a sum of your events' carbon footprint.\nWhat data collects the virtual event calculator?\n- Data on participants : number of participants.\n- Data on sessions : number of sessions and time length each session.\n- It also collects data for any marketing material involved : Waste generated from all marketing materials is treated according to EU and national regulations in all European countries. Emissions from waste are varied based on the type of end-of-life treatment of the materials.\n- Data on packages transportation : number of packages sent, total weight and specific destinations.\nFor illustration, Plan A organised a virtual event with 80 participants for an hour session and no marketing materials or transportation. The calculator estimated the virtual event's total carbon footprint at 3 , 54 kg C0 2 - from electricity and servers consumption.\nHow to decarbonise online events?\nCompanies need to decarbonise their activities. Plan A's virtual event calculator delivers reduction plans to help companies reduce their emissions linked to these specific activities .\nHere is a small snapshot of what kind of reduction activities you can undertake :\n- Decarbonise the electrical grid, if virtual conferences were powered via renewables energies such as solar panels, the carbon footprint of such conferences could fall from three quarters.\n- Turn your camera off during a videoconference; you can reduce your environmental footprint in that meeting by 96% .\nWhat gets measured gets reduced and decarbonised.

In the race towards net-zero, carbon accounting provides us with the tools not only to quantify and measure carbon emissions but also to help us make informed decisions in regards to climate mitigation strategies. But which method and tools to use? To help companies make the best-informed decisions, Plan A has designed a comprehensive infographic.\nWhat is carbon accounting?\nCarbon accounting covers a range of practices aimed at calculating how much carbon a company or country emits .\u00a0To understand a company's carbon footprint, the first step is to calculate the emissions linked with companies activities, also within the supply chain.\u00a0For this, companies may choose between four different carbon accounting methods: supplier-specific method, physical-unit method, spend-based method and hybrid method.\nHow to choose the best carbon accounting method for your company? An infographic for businesses. Credit: Plan A\nCarbon accounting helps corporates know precisely how much carbon emissions the company is emitting, so that reduction targets can be set.

The latest COP26 showed the growing corporates\u2019 commitments to building a net-zero economy. More than 1,045 companies representing $23 trillion in market capitalisation (more than the GDP of the United States) are committed to science-based targets emissions reduction. Companies succeeding in translating climate commitments into concrete actions will achieve a sustainable leading status.\nIt is no secret, 2022 is the year for corporate climate action . It is a great opportunity to put words into action . But it is easier said than done, how can businesses make 2022 a year of corporate action on sustainability?\nA recent survey by INSEAD revealed the apparent disconnect between what board members say about the importance of climate change and what they do. 75% stated that climate change is fundamental to the strategic success of their companies. However, 43% of companies do not yet have clear targets for reducing carbon emissions (or did not know if this was the case). 50% stated they are not entirely satisfied with their company\u2019s reporting to the board on addressing climate change issues. But the good news is that this knowledge gap can be quickly closed.\nIn the Climate of business , our CEO, Lubomila Jordanova shares with companies practical tips on becoming sustainability leaders.\nSustainability tips to make 2022 the year of corporate climate action\nThe Climate Targets of Fortune 500 Companies: you do not have to be a mega-corporation to achieve a sustainable leading status.\nCredit: Visual Capitalist\nFor businesses\nPut the resources \u2013 often, what we see when speaking to prospects or clients is the limit on resources working on the sustainability / ESG agenda. Think about people, tools, and knowledge. The basic need for a company to succeed sustainability within a year is at least one person and a budget for tools. This person will need to implement this topic across departments, which also helps. One thing is sure: people want to be involved and loyal to sustainability leaders . They want to be accurate in their measurement and maximize impact. They are looking for ways their industry can become sustainability leaders while making a difference.\nSet a target \u2013 it is excellent to embed climate and ESG in your long-term strategy, but setting short-term tangible targets is the key if you want to claim leadership in the topic in the longer and shorter term. We often see companies getting incredibly ambitious about sustainability and wanting to see results fast \u2013 this is achievable if you break it down in small steps for the coming 12 months.\nSet a timeline and some buffer \u2013 sustainability sadly still needs a buffer when you plan to implement a plan. When engaging your employees, customers, and suppliers, expect it will take time. They sporadically connect to a topic that is not yet legislatively obliging them to behave sustainably. Make them part of the journey if you want results, but allow real-time to align them.\nFor chief sustainability officers and sustainability leads\nLike a flower, sustainability takes time to reach its final point.\nCredit: Edward Howell\nEducation first \u2013 the most likely reason for a sustainability agenda to fail is the lack of understanding across stakeholders why it matters at all. At Plan A, we often see that the vital ingredient to a quick turnaround in approvals, prioritisation of projects, or general implementation of decarbonisation activities; happens when the different stakeholders are aligned on why this matters. Spend time engaging your team, board, or management or work with a partner that can help you on this.\nShare ownership \u2013 once the team \u201cget it\u201d, they most likely would want to become part of the projects you are leading. Even though probably you are the most knowledgeable on the sustainability topic, getting your team to show part of the implementation of your sustainability agenda is crucial. Often, sustainability is a topic that personally engages the team, the board, and the management. By letting them in, you can rely on their support for the future.\nConnect it to the traditional KPIs \u2013 a \u201clanguage barrier\u201d for sustainability professionals, even after the team and the board are educated on the topic\u2019s importance, is how does sustainability translate to money?\nAt this phase of our economy, we still speak about GDP, MRR, ARR, CAC, and EBIDTA. Connect your requests for budgets to the expected ROI. For example, how is sustainability leadership help with employee retention, customer engagement, and revenue increase? Tell this story, and you will have everyone on board.\nChanging the climate reporting for board members\nWhen making the business case for sustainability, think outside the box. How can you match environmental performance with financial performance?\nCredit: Markus Spiske\nEducation first \u2013 when speaking to sustainability leaders, I sometimes hear how they feel their board doesn\u2019t \u201cget it\u201d and doesn\u2019t prioritise sustainability enough as it is not bringing the expected ROI. Spending time on learning about the anticipated climate risks, the costs associated with them, the shift in consumer preferences in favour of sustainability and transparency, and the basics of sustainability would help you see the long-term value in the investment in sustainability today and allow you to sit on the table with the leaders of any company speaking the language of tomorrow. To be early might be challenging, but to be too late will be devastating.\nAnna Borg, Chief Executive Officer, Vattenfall\nDrive the discussion \u2013 Maybe you already know but don\u2019t see the board rooms you participate in express interest in sustainability. Lead the way. Business as usual is irrelevant, be it because of COVID, remote work, cryptocurrencies, NFTs, but also, of course, climate disasters in the last 12 months. The stereotype of the past discussion is irrelevant if it doesn\u2019t include sustainability and ESG. Even if only legislation is the reason.\nCommit for the short term \u2013 after the common understanding of sustainability and ESG has been established, focus on agreeing or promoting short-term goals. No one will claim the leadership better than the one that got their priorities straight today and engaged all the suppliers, customers, and employees ( Scope 3 ) tomorrow.\nMake your company a sustainability leader by working with Plan A.

Initially established on the 5th of June 1973 and led by the United Nations, this year\u2019s theme goes back to its roots using the same topic as its launch in 1973, fifty years ago: Only One Earth .\u00a0\n2022 is a historic milestone for the global environmental community . It marks 50 years since the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment , widely seen as the first international meeting on the environment. The 1972 Stockholm Conference spurred the formation of environment ministries and agencies around the world and kickstarted a host of new global agreements to collectively protect the environment. Each year, World Environment Day is hosted by a different country where the official celebrations take place. The host country for 2022 is Sweden - showcasing its work for the environment for the past decades.\nThe 1972 United Nations Conference on the Environment in Stockholm\nCredit: The United Nations\nAs nature cannot keep up with our demands, we are running out of time to save our planet - at this rate, we would need the equivalent of 1.6 Earths to maintain our current way of life. This is the message that the organisers of World Environment Day want to highlight.\nWe are running out of time to make amends , and that is why, at Plan A, enabling businesses to reach net-zero has been our mission since day one.\u00a0 In celebration of World Environment Day, we will be focusing on waste. Waste management is one of the most overlooked and impactful aspects of a company - With a growing population, increased demand for goods, and consuming habits, tracking and managing waste has become a seemingly complicated issue. That is why Plan A has decided to measure and reduce its waste footprint. How? Our sustainability initiative team has implemented a solution to accurately measure and reduce all types of waste in our offices. We hope that our use case will inspire companies and individuals to do the same.\u00a0\nThe world of waste in data\n- According to Eurostat , waste is the fourth most significant source of emissions in the EU (food waste accounts for 10% of global GHG emissions). In 2050, the world will generate 3.4 billion tons of solid waste per year, representing a 70% increase.\n- Only 20% of the current global waste is recycled , the rest being sent to landfills or burnt (releasing GHG emissions in the process).\u00a0\n- Respectively, 100 companies are responsible for more than 90% of all global plastic waste , according to new research from The Plastic Waste Makers index.\n- Approximately 13 tons of hazardous waste is generated every second. Every year, that\u2019s 400 million tons of dangerous waste \u2192 equal to the weight of 8 million adult whales .\u00a0\n- Over 9 million tonnes of electrical items have been disposed of\u2014more than the weight of four Burj Khalifa s (2.2 million tonnes), the tallest building globally.\nThe global waste composition Source: World Bank Data\nWaste Management for companies: the Plan A method\nIt is no secret: waste management pertains to scope 3 emissions, category 5. As such it is part of the largest scope of emissions to monitor for a service company.\u00a0 Knowing that only a fraction of companies reports on this scope, it is your opportunity to make a difference and lead the way for World Environment Day. Therefore, companies must disclose this primary source of emissions to accurately consider and cover all scopes of emissions.\nGlobal treatment and disposal of waste Credit: World Bank Data\nThe waste challenge for World Environment Day: collect this trash data\nCompanies tend to focus on electricity, heating, or employee commuting and often forget about the waste generated during their operations to reduce their environmental impact. Waste comes in different shapes, colours and sizes: e-waste, hazardous, liquid, organic or solid waste is generated daily - and its effect on the environment worsens. Companies' bad waste management can be translated into high waste management costs, bad reputation, and economic sanctions - hence the importance and urgency of tackling our waste today.\nThe main challenge for companies is that waste data is the trickiest to collect and measure . For instance, the lack of available framework, adequate infrastructure, technology and resources makes it especially difficult for companies to collect reliable data\u00a0- for example, it is not as easy as finding your electricity consumption on your bill. Also, waste management depends on so many stakeholders it is extremely challenging to collect quantitative or qualitative waste flow data. Companies need to develop in-house solutions to learn how to better measure their waste.\nFor each waste management problem, there is a solution\nAt Plan A, tracking our carbon emissions and reducing our generated waste is one of our top priorities. We are using our waste management module - allowing users to add and oversee operational waste data for different waste categories, giving insights into your Scope 3 Category 5 emissions .\nOur green team started a conversation with stakeholders involved in collecting data to collect waste. After exploring diverse solutions, Ruiqi Li, our customer success associate, built a team of seven volunteers and organised weekly reflections. Thus, three times a week, our volunteering team weights the bins in the office and inputs the data into Plan A\u2019s platform.\nOur Sustainability Initiative team measures our office\u2019s waste daily. Credit: Plan A\nRuiqi Lui explains: \u201cWe encountered a couple of challenges when trying to collect waste data through our landlord. This is why we decided to gather a group of Plan A volunteers to weigh and translate the volume of our waste bins into kilograms. We weigh the bins three times a week and keep track of how full the bin is. At the end of our experiment, we will develop an average weight number per person and the bin for each waste type. The goal is to share our experience with our customers and derive an advanced waste measurement plan for them.\u201d\nTip: Do you not have the data? Create your average data by using an average weight per waste type for one person or an average weight per waste type per bin.\nA small step for your company, a giant leap for the environment\nThis waste experiment that Ruiqi Li conducted at Plan A was enriching and provided many positive outcomes that your company can also benefit from.\nContrary to what people think, there was an overwhelming response to joining the waste squad, and everyone was very excited by the initiative. Our volunteering group is highly diverse: different departments, cultures, values and personalities, which brings new ideas to the table, creates awareness of the topic and makes the conversation more straightforward. It is also an excellent way to get to know new colleagues. Once taking care of office waste, you become more conscious of your waste.\nRuiqi Li, Customer Success Associate at Plan A\nOn a company level, the waste collection initiative is the fastest way to make your organisation aware of its environmental impact while fast tracking sustainability, innovation, and automation. Once you know how your waste stream contributes to your carbon footprint, you will be able to start implementing strategies to reduce waste-related GHG emissions. This is an opportunity to impact BOTH carbon emissions and building waste significantly.\nFor World Environment Day, collect, measure, reduce and sort your waste\nTo highlight our climate action for World Environment Day, Ruqui Li from our sustainability initiative team has compiled a six steps process to collect and measure waste:\nStep 1: Ensure employees understand different waste types by posting relevant information near bins for plastic, paper, residual, glass and organic waste.\nStep 2: Ask the cleaning staff/landlord about the frequency of their waste collection .\nStep 3: If the cleaning staff cannot help, mobilise your green team !\nStep 4: Collect and weigh the bins of each waste type in the office (weight the bin, but take off the initial weight of the container)\nStep 5: Allocate and track your team\u2019s responsibilities through a self-reporting sheet displayed in the office waste area.\nStep 6: Check if it is possible to extrapolate the waste data from the observed months for the rest of the year (either via average weight of waste per person or via average weight of bins).\nThe benefits of waste management\nWorld Environment Day is not the only day that companies should act. Companies successfully implementing waste management policy and action plans can expect the following benefits:\u00a0\n- Cost savings and cutting waste disposal costs\n- Meeting environmental regulations and finding new sources of revenue: you can sell your waste products to other companies to reuse and recycle.\n- Reduced environmental liability for your company & increase environmental awareness for stakeholders and employees\n- A boost to your business' image for being environmentally aware\n- Increased employee engagement and retention\n- Systematic control of your waste issues\n- Increased business opportunities - many large companies and government organisations won't work with a business that doesn't have a sustainability policy implemented.\nThis year's World Environment Day comes with the planet facing a triple crisis of climate change , nature and biodiversity loss, and pollution and waste. Your company will showcase its environmental awareness and actions by tackling one of these most pressing issues: waste. Thus, your company will drastically reduce its carbon and waste footprint by measuring your waste while preserving our biodiversity.\nStart your waste management today with Plan A .\nRead more\nBilan Carbone: Your complete guide\nCorporate Sustainability\nDecarbonisation strategy: The comprehensive guide for 2024\nCorporate Sustainability\nDecarbonisation strategy for SMEs: Top 10 low-hanging fruits for immediate impact\nCorporate Sustainability\nNo items found.\nGet your company on the path to net-zero\nBook a call with our sustainability experts\nGet in touch", "source": "https://plana.earth/academy/world-environment-day-measure-reduce-emissions-waste", "metadata": {"title": "World Environment Day: Measure and reduce emissions from waste"}}

Accordingly, the financial industry acts as a vital lever for change within the path towards net-zero due to financial institutions lying at the centre of the economy; they have vast amounts of capital to move, they have employees to engage, and they work closely with highly influential stakeholders.\nHowever, banks simply cannot decarbonise on their own. An intersectional approach underpinned by assessment, commitment, and engagement, is paramount to achieving net-zero carbon emissions.\nNet-zero refers to cutting greenhouse gas emissions to as close to zero as possible , with any remaining emissions re-absorbed from the atmosphere by oceans and forests, for instance. Net-zero is reached when a business has eliminated all the carbon emissions it could and then compensated the remaining emissions with beyond value chain mitigation.\nThe net-zero process starts with calculating emissions across Scope 1, 2, and 3, setting science-based targets, developing decarbonisation pathways until 2030, and gradually moving towards long-term carbon capture, storage, and sequestration for those emissions which cannot be reduced.\nThe historical role of banks within the net-zero journey\nBanks have historically under-utilised their resources in achieving net-zero and decarbonisation. Whilst many central banks have previously engaged in unsustainable investment practices, a global shift towards net-zero carbon has subsequently posed crucial questions surrounding the environmental responsibilities of the financial sector.\nAccordingly, the UN launched the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) in 2021 for banks that were willing to commit to net-zero carbon emissions across their lending portfolios by 2050. The new group includes 53 of the biggest banks from 27 countries with \u20ac35 trillion in assets.\nThis is crucial as the banks that signed up have put their credibility on the line. Therefore, they must demonstrate progress on this big commitment made by making more investments in the sustainable transition by divesting to avoid being scrutinised.\nThe importance of banks in global decarbonisation\nThe financial sector is at the core of our economy and defines the direction in which the wind blows for the corporate sector, but for all businesses. With their loans, the underwriting of corporate stock, bond offerings, and investment portfolios they change the mindset of the many. They work under the close governance of the regulators, shareholders and communities.\nHowever, banks simply cannot decarbonise the economy on their own. Even in Europe, which is far ahead of the US, there is a \u20ac4 trillion mismatch between the available pool of money and the corporations that currently qualify as Paris-aligned, according to a recent report by CDP-Europe and Oliver Wyman .\n\u20ac4 trillion ambition gap (Source: Oliver Wyman)\nHow banks can sustainably support global decarbonisation\nFor banks to support the transition of the economy to a sustainable model they must invest and divest . UNEP FI estimates that for full decarbonisation, the world needs investments in the order of 4.7 to 6.6 trillion euros per year. In the meantime, tens of trillions of dollars are spent yearly on the exploration, extraction, refinement, and transportation of fossil fuels. On top of this, we have the building, sale, installation and use of things that burn fossil fuels to generate electricity, and transport people and goods. All of these activities have to be funded somehow and this is the key to the global decarbonisation agenda.\nSo, what steps should financial institutions take?\nAssessment: Banks need to start measuring their full Scope 1, 2, and 3, meaning incorporating in their assessment of climate-related risks all financed activities. At the moment this is mainly done with the use of averages which leads to inaccurate calculations, which can be off by around 20-30%.\nCommitment: The Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) is a step in the right direction as the committed banks have made it clear sustainability is a priority for the future and if they don't deliver they can expect backlash. Openly committing to mitigating climate risks thereby requires engagement in a process of divestment and the implementation of sustainable finance practices. Accordingly, this thereby allows those trusting their money with a certain financial institution to be assured their money will be there as the crisis unfolds.\nEngagement: You can't decarbonise without reducing your Scope 3 and given how diverse the definition of this is for the financial sector (see visual below), you need to get these stakeholders engaged fast as they require time to implement.\nThe financial sector landscape (Source:\u00a0GHG\u00a0Protocol)\nA few other key steps which also assist in the journey towards creating a sustainable economy include:\nA global emissions database - ideally open-source and free so products can be built on top - facilitates the creation of reliable benchmarks and net zero target-setting for a cluster of industries.\nA clear carbon tax - businesses, and respectively banks, need a universal way to estimate the volume and cost of carbon.\nA global agreement on the accounting practices related to carbon - we need a universal language when we are assessing the progress on decarbonisation. At the moment there isn't full clarity on which businesses emit how much.\nMap of carbon taxes and emissions trading systems worldwide (Source:\u00a0WikiMedia)\nIn summary, the vast extent to which banks act as a lever for change within the global decarbonisation agenda reflects their central position within the economy. In order to meet global-net zero targets, banks must utilise their vast amounts of capital, engage their employees, and work closely with their highly influential stakeholders. Utilising these levers for change within an intersectional approach underpinned by assessment, commitment, and engagement will thus be vital in achieving net-zero carbon emissions globally.\nTo learn about how Plan A can help banks, see Plan A\u2019s latest collaboration with Deutsche Bank.\nRead more\nBilan Carbone: Your complete guide\nCorporate Sustainability\nDecarbonisation strategy: The comprehensive guide for 2024\nCorporate Sustainability\nDecarbonisation strategy for SMEs: Top 10 low-hanging fruits for immediate impact\nCorporate Sustainability\nNet-zero journey, explained\nClimate Science\nThe Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)\nPolicy & Regulations\nThe carbon bubble - towards a new financial crisis?\nClimate Science\nGet your company on the path to net-zero\nBook a call with our sustainability experts\nGet in touch", "source": "https://plana.earth/academy/how-banks-can-lead-way-global-decarbonisation", "metadata": {"title": "How banks can lead the way to global decarbonisation", "content": ["Banking", "Finance", "Decarbonisation "]}}

In doing so, CFO\u2019s will need to incorporate scientifically backed sustainability information to guide their choices that enable strong financial performance. Today\u2019s CFO\u2019s work closely alongside Chief Executive Officers (CEO\u2019s), CSO\u2019s, and board members, to develop a sustainable business model; utilising financial and non-financial information to achieve a company\u2019s strategic goals, its resource and capital allocation, and measure its long and short-term performance.\nWhilst the position of a CFO has historically been defined by a focus upon the measurement, management and reporting elements of financial value, CFO\u2019s are increasingly taking on wider responsibilities directly related to the business\u2019 sustainability and ESG related goals. Whilst there is hesitancy from CFO\u2019s who are yet to understand the direct relevance of ESG factors to financial performance; other CFO\u2019s are gladly accepting this extension in responsibility in the hopes of creating long-term value. Furthermore, the forthcoming EU regulations will increase the financial penalties for organisations which do not meet policy requirements; therefore, CFO\u2019s who undertake leadership on sustainability issues and ESG objectives will ultimately future-proof their business through reducing financial risk whilst creating long-term value.\nNot only will compliance and reporting requirements increase within the coming years, but the preferences and values from investors will shift to become sustainability-oriented. As such, CFO\u2019s must utilise the vast abilities of the finance function to build trust among both internal and external stakeholders. Through utilising an array of financial tools, whether it be forecasting, budgeting or allocating funds, CFO\u2019s are able to place a fundamental focus upon sustainability factors to ensure they are a primary focus within all business decisions relating to value creation. CFO\u2019s are increasingly asking sustainability-oriented questions such as:\n- How can a business or organisation provide a value-oriented perspective on climate-related physical and transition risk?\n- How can a business or organisation understand the impact and opportunities of carbon pricing and incentives?\n- How can a business or organisation deliver accurate ESG reporting to meet the needs of reporting requirements and external stakeholders, such as investors?\nSimply put, the role of the CFO within the sustainability strategy of a company will inevitably become indispensable. If a company is able to find a balance between meeting short-term performance requirements and long-term sustainability goals, the extent to which CFO\u2019s play a paramount role within long-term value creation will inevitably be recognised within their long-term performance.\nCFO's who aim to embrace sustainability are required to meet these objectives. (Source: PWC )\nHow do CFO's transition in order to meet the demands of sustainability?\nFor many CFO\u2019s, the idea of transitioning towards focussing upon sustainability within their financial strategy may be seen as daunting. However, it is recommended that organisations and companies undertake the following steps to ensure a smooth transition.\n- Firstly, not only the CFO - but every person within a company or organisation - should be adequately trained and given the knowledge required to meet the evolving demands of sustainability.\n- Next, sustainability should be embedded into every aspect of the organisation. An effective sustainability strategy requires alignment throughout the whole organisation through actions such a; measuring sustainability performance within departmental reporting, and embedding sustainability targets within the remuneration of executives.\n- Lastly, technology should be leveraged to ensure the process of transitioning towards a sustainability focussed strategy is as smooth and efficient as possible. Utilising existing technology, such as Plan A\u2019s comprehensive ESG platform , to integrate automated data controls related to ESG is central to ensuring compliance.\nThe financial requirements within the transition to a carbon-led economy (Source:\u00a0EY )\n\u200d\nIsn\u2019t this the CSO's responsibility?\nMany CFOs are bewildered by the thought of sustainability measurement, management and reporting becoming a financial responsibility as they believe this is the role of the Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO).\nThis may be true in many cases, as CSO\u2019s increasingly take on responsibility across the areas of compliance, strategy, and even finance. However, many companies do not have a formal CSO in place, whilst many have sustainability delegates \u00a0who are well below the C-suite - meaning they do not have a direct line of contact with the board of directors. The CFO plays a vital role in such cases to ensure a business is meeting its climate goals due to their direct influence upon key business decisions and their direct involvement with key stakeholders who have ever-evolving demands.\nRegardless of the organisational framework, the roles and responsibilities of CFO\u2019s and CSO\u2019s are interconnected; thus they must work in collaboration to meet the long-term financial and sustainability goals of a company.\nMoving forward, CFO's will have to be more dynamic, patient and flexible than ever\nThe growing requirements for CFO's who wish to create long-term value across broad stakeholders. (Source:\u00a0PWC )\nAs the demands of sustainability evolve, CFO\u2019s will be increasingly required to adapt to the growing requirements and forms associated with value creation. CFO\u2019s who are able to accept the ambiguous, and sometimes uncertain, nature of change will be able to explore new forms of creating value in a sustainable manner. Through embedding sustainability across all financial decision-making processes and procedures, and sharing both financial and non-financial data to internal and external stakeholders; companies and organisations will realise the paramount leadership role that the CFO plays in building transparency, trust and momentum within a business.\nThrough utilising sustainability as a tool to create value in an increasingly dynamic marketplace, CFO\u2019s will mitigate financial risk and thus accelerate the achievement of their company\u2019s long-term financial goals. A study by Verizon found that over a 15-year period, ESG programs have on average increased shareholder value by \u20ac1.18 billion. Meanwhile, carbon taxes increased from \u20ac9.7 in 2018, to over \u20ac87.5 per metric ton in February 2022. As such, it is now more than ever crucial for CFO\u2019s to harness sustainability as a tool in order to avoid risk, bolster their bottom-line, and future-proof their business.\nIn summary, CFO\u2019s who undertake leadership on sustainability initiatives are required to play three fundamental interconnected roles which are inevitably being transformed by the growing demands of sustainability and the subsequent transition to a low-carbon economy.\n- Being a strategic visionary ; through the development and implementation of a sustainable long-term financial strategy which balances resources and financial risk \u00a0to contribute to a business\u2019 triple bottom line (people, the planet and profit).\n- Being a collaborator ; through liaising with internal and external stakeholders to ensure a commitment to sustainability is embedded across a company's wider network.\n- Ensuring effective communication ; through a CFO who can translate the value of a company\u2019s sustainability strategy to stakeholders - such as investors.\nWant to learn more about how your business can mitigate financial risk through sustainability?

Small variations in the atmospheric concentration of these gases lead to significant changes in temperature that make the difference between ice ages when mammoths roamed planet Earth and the heat in which the dinosaurs dominated the planet. Greenhouses gases are normally characterised using two main indicators: Global Warming Potential - a relative measure of how much heat a greenhouse gas traps in the atmosphere; and the atmospheric lifetime - which measures the lifetime of the gas in the atmosphere. The first indicator expresses itself in CO 2 equivalent (how much more or less greenhouse this gas is compared to CO 2 ) and the second is measured by the time it takes for gas to disappear from the atmosphere.\nMeet SF6, CO 2 's larger cousin\nAmong all the greenhouse gases that exist, CO 2 gets the most attention. Today, we bring a different perspective. Think about everything that you know about CO 2 and multiply it by roughly 24,000. This is how much a gas called SF6 (sulphur hexafluoride) is stronger than CO 2 in terms of global warming potential.\nYou read right: SF6 is the most potent greenhouse gas in existence with a global warming potential of 23,900 times the baseline of CO 2 . It means that one tonne of SF6 in the atmosphere equals 23,900 tonnes of CO 2 .\nEven worse, SF6 is synthetic and it does not have a natural sink or any effective disposal methods, thus, when emitted, simply accumulates in the atmosphere. A cherry on top is that its atmospheric lifetime can be up to 3,200 years, which is well beyond CO 2 \u2018s 100-200- year lifetime. A gas 24k times more powerful than CO 2 with a lifetime 16 times longer than CO 2 is being released into our atmosphere, and very few people have the least idea.\nWhat is this crazy gas used for?\nThe energy industry is SF6\u2019s biggest consumer\u2013 it consumes more than 80% of the gas. SF6 is mostly used inside switchgear \u2013 which is an absolutely essential component of any electricity grid.\u00a0 They are also used inside wind turbines, which means that neither wind energy as such, nor electricity, in general, can be claimed to be completely environmentally friendly.\nSF6 is known for its isolating potential in electricity. As such, it is a favoured material for energy infrastructures. When it comes to total consumption, yearly SF6 emissions are equivalent to the annual CO 2 emissions produced by approximately 100 million cars. Forecasts show that SF6 usage might grow, parallel to those industries, by 50% in 2030.\nWhy is SF6 not banned yet?\nIn 2014, the European Commission tried to ban SF6 (in the framework of its F-Gas Regulation No. 517/2014 ), but it did not affect its use in the electrical industry. The reason for this was that, at the time, there were no commercially viable SF6-free alternatives to the existing switchgear. This regulation will be revised in 2020 where new technologies on the market will be assessed to see if they could possibly lead to a reduction in the usage of SF6. In this context, the German company Nuventura is introducing a new technology and design method to remove altogether the need for this gas in electricity grids. With this new technique, the gas is replaced by... plain air!\nWhat\u2019s the effect on humans?\nIn its normal state SF6 is generally relatively harmless for human health. This is one of the reasons\u00a0why it is not taken as seriously as it should be. In fact, if you google SF6, most of the content that you will find will be people having fun with it (because of its ability to bring even your voice on the Dark Side making you sound like Darth Vader). Fun, but not so much when you know the rest of this gas' properties.\nAre there any alternatives out there?\nAn eco-friendly alternative to SF6-using switchgear has been developed by Nuventura, which is currently in a pilot stage in collaboration with one of the biggest German energy companies \u2013 Innogy/Westnetz. In a nutshell, they redesigned the switchgear\u2019s basic principles, so that instead of using SF6 as the insulating medium, it is now possible to simply use the air we all breathe. Their design has simplified the traditional switchgear design and allows for additional monitoring features that improve the performance of the SF6-using switchgear. This will not remove SF6 switch gears from the market altogether nor instantly, but this is a major step to lowering invisible pollution and solving a problem that is equivalent to 100,000,000 extra cars on the road each year.\nSF6 is an example of many of the problems that we don't think of. Climate action is everywhere. The simplification of our processes, our industries and our activities is a priority for all sustainable efforts to be met with success. Solutions proposed by innovative green businesses need promoting, pushing and explaining.\nSource: The article is based on the facts presented in the research of N. Ottersbach \u201cSulphur Hexafluoride (SF6): Should the EU ban the world\u2019s most potent greenhouse gas?\u201d, 2018.\nIra is a communications specialist with a passion for socially important topics. She is currently the head of communications for Nuventura with previous experience of implementing the European Commission\u2019s campaigns on gender equality and smart tourism among others. Nuventura develops switchgear that empowers the grids of the future. Built on the principles of sustainable design, nuventura has fundamentally reconceived traditional gas insulated switchgear (GIS) by introducing smart grid technology and eliminating the need for SF6 - the world\u2019s most potent greenhouse gas.\nRead more\nScience-based targets and SBTi, explained\nClimate Science\nWhat is the difference between carbon-neutral, net-zero and climate positive?\nClimate Science\nWhat does net-zero emissions mean, and how to achieve it?\nClimate Science\nHow to spot greenwashing\nCorporate Sustainability\nStart a Green Team in your Company\nCorporate Sustainability\nIs it too late to save our planet?\nClimate Science\nGet your company on the path to net-zero\nBook a call with our sustainability experts\nGet in touch", "source": "https://plana.earth/academy/most-powerful-greenhouse-gas", "metadata": {"title": "Have you heard of the most powerful greenhouse gas we know?", "content": ["Greehouse gas emissions", "carbon emissions", "Climate change"]}}

Almost daily, scientific reports, news stories and environmental problems throw more onto the pile of evidence that our planet is in crisis. The increase of wildfires, the disappearance of endangered species such as polar bears and scarcity of natural resources are leading humanity to face the consequences of our excessive carbon footprint .\nThe science behind climate change is complex, and the outcomes uncertain. While environmental solutions must be implemented on a global scale, you can undertake day-to-day actions, to reduce your carbon footprint on the environment, at home and the office. Plan A has curated for you a list of the top options for reducing your carbon footprint. Say hello to a carbon-neutral life .\nWhat is a carbon footprint?\nWhat is a carbon footprint? credit: W.Carter\nYou have heard this concept everywhere, but you still find it hard to grasp the whole meaning of carbon footprint. A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions that come from the production, use and end-of-life of a product or service. It includes gases such as CO 2 (the most common gas emitted by humans), including methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases. Those gases remain trapped in the atmosphere, causing climate change.\nThe term \"carbon footprint\" was first promoted and popularised by BP Petroleum, through its advertising campaign. The aim was to demonstrate that climate change is a result of individual activities, rather than oil giants themselves. Critics wonder if \" carbon footprint\" is a sham , misleading people in what truly matters, when it comes to climate change. However, \"carbon footprint\" can be expanded beyond the initial BP concept. You can reduce yours by being an engaged citizen who recognises how to mitigate climate change's impact .\u00a0\nWilling to push your galactic limits? Start monitoring your company's carbon emissions, thanks to our carbon footprint calculator software .\nThe carbon footprint bucket list\u00a0\nLike a kid writing a Christmas letter to Santa Claus, you can start your own \" carbon-neutral \" bucket list, at an individual level and corporate level.\nAvoid short-haul flights\nLook at the sky, rather than hopping on short-haul flights.\nCredit: Ali Abdul Rahman\nGreta Thunberg gave up on flights, and so can you. Short trips produce more significant amounts of GHG emissions , per passenger than longer flights. Around the world, aviation emits about 860 million metric tons of carbon dioxide every year, or about\u00a02% of total global greenhouse gas emissions . The issue is that aeroplanes emit more than CO 2 emissions. It emits particulates, sulfur and nitrogen compounds, which highly contributes to climate change.\nAlso, 25% of jet fuel is consumed during takeoff , making short-haul flights the opposite of sustainable. As the industry is still working on electro fuels and miraculous technologies, the only solution now is, avoid short haul-flights. You do not need to eat a pizza in Napoli, each weekend, just because flights are cheaper than your monthly underground ticket.\nHop on a train ride , enjoy the landscape, sit back, and feel guilt-free. You will arrive on time and relaxed for your business meetings. Congratulations, you have made the first step to reduce your carbon footprint.\u00a0\nSwitch to a green electricity supplier\nWelcome the green force into your home and office.\nCredit: Jason Blackeye\nSwitching to renewable energy providers will reduce your office carbon footprint . There is an extensive panel of choices: from solar power, wind power, hydropower to geothermal power. edShifting to green energy, limits harmful emissions in the atmosphere, alongside decreasing air, water and soil pollution. Are you not convinced yet? Green energies have consistent prices , that will keep reducing within the next years. By acting that way, you will also reduce your electricity bill. Your bank account and the planet is thanking you.\nIncrease heating and cooling efficiency\nCooling appliances are by definition, not sustainable.\nCredit: Ashkan Forouzani\nHeating and cooling have enormous environmental impacts . For example, cooling towers take natural water from the environment, and once out of the cooling system, throw the water back into nature. However, the water released is hotter, damaging ecosystems. Another example is air conditioning, highly harmful to the environment. It releases tremendous quantities of CO 2 emissions, increasing your carbon footprint. Improve your heating and cooling efficiency by lowering thermostats, and regularly changing your filters.\nGo to work by bike\u00a0\nBike to work.\nCredit: Tiffany Nutt\nGoing carless is the best thing that will happen to you and your carbon footprint. Enjoy the many benefits of bike riding: diminished transportation costs, the end of traffic congestion, decreased carbon emissions and, improved cardiovascular health . At Plan A , all employees are going to work by bike, and let us tell you; they are in good shape. Want to know more about the environmental benefits of biking?\nWork from home regularly\nWork remotely, enjoy the comfort of your home.\nCredit: Alizee Baudez\nDid you know that the home office is significantly reducing your carbon footprint? As you do not need to commute to work, you are decreasing CO 2 emissions released in the atmosphere.\u00a0Global Workforce Analytics , estimates that working from home half the week can reduce emissions by 54 million tons every year .\nEach day, billions of people commute to work, often by car, burning fossil fuels at an alarming rate. By working home, you reduce fuel usage while limiting the release of toxic pollutants. Also, letting your employees work remotely, it reduces your office waste by half.\nRemote employees create less waste , as every tool used is digital (e.g. emails, digital note-taking, no printing). Running an office is also costly in energy (e.g. heating and cooling); remote work enables employees to monitor their energy consumption .\u00a0\nReduce your company's carbon footprint by using our carbon footprint calculator software.

Reducing your carbon emissions seems to be the slogan of the year, but how do companies start with such a blurry task? How do we measure progress? Back in 1954, Peter Drucker wrote the premise of an answer: \u201cwhat gets measured, gets managed.\u201d\nIf a company really wants to become more sustainable, the first step it should take is trying to understand its current situation and start monitoring its carbon emissions.\nMeasuring carbon emissions is not an easy task. Major companies that do not have carbon measuring and reducing programmes have become the exception to the rule. Apple, Facebook and even oil giants like Shell or BP all report on their CO 2 emissions. This is not just because these CEOs care about the environment.\nLess CO 2\u00a0= less costs\nIdentifying and quantifying CO 2\u00a0emissions helps to identify excessive energy usage or other inefficiencies. Lowering GHG emissions typically goes hand in hand with increasing efficiency and cost-effectiveness in a company's processes.\nThe global retail stores Walmart have used carbon measurements to identify key inefficiencies (Credit: UpstateNYer)\nWalmart identified through its GHG emissions that they spend a lot of energy on the heating and cooling of their buildings. Because of this, they installed around 10 000 high-efficiency rooftop heating and cooling units. These units avoid 614 000 tonnes of CO 2 per year. This also led to \u20ac8 million in cost savings .\nAccess the carbon market\nIn addition to the internal cost reductions, more and more companies have to pay a price for every tonne of CO 2\u00a0they emit. This is the so-called carbon emission trading system.\nThe principle is simple (Credit: Climate Policy Info Hub)\nGlobally, already\u00a057 carbon pricing systems have been implemented, 28 in the form of an Emission Trading System (ETS) and 29 carbon taxes. The value of traded global markets for carbon dioxide (CO2) allowances soared 250% between 2018 and 2019 to a record high of \u20ac144 billion. In an ETS, a maximum number of tonnes of CO 2\u00a0is turned into allowances, and companies can buy and sell these allowances according to their emissions.\nThe other format, a carbon tax, is a set price you have to pay per unit of carbon emission. Within both carbon pricing systems, you are obliged to measure your emissions. A lot of people advocate that these systems are THE solution to make a real change.\nCarbon trading schemes is becoming a norm across the world (Credit: World Bank)\nOn a trend level, more carbon pricing initiatives are emerging, prices for GHG emissions are on the rise and the private sector is implementing internal carbon pricing systems of its own. Monitoring and lowering your carbon emissions is not only becoming an obligation, but also a business opportunity to get ahead of competitors. All of this is only available, however, if your company measures its carbon emissions, the first step to survive the sustainable market shift.\nTransparency is the new black\nAnother very good reason to start measuring and reducing your carbon emissions is your brand image. Customers, whether company or individuals, care about who they do business with.\nSustainable conscience is on the rise, as demonstrated in the streets , polls and business circles. According to Euromonitor International\u2019s latest sustainability survey , 54 % of global consumers believe that ethical purchase decisions make a difference. Clients are looking for ways to lower individual and collective carbon footprint, minimise waste, buy green products and get services from environmentally-friendly companies.\nBusinesses have everything to gain from reducing their emissions\nTransparency over emissions has become so basic that even the most polluting industries disclose their (vast) footprint. In a race to become the most sustainable carriers, major airlines like Easyjet and Delta have announced sweeping plans to measure, reduce and offset their respective carbon footprint.\nThe sustainable market is not going anywhere\nSustainability awareness is something that is very likely to continue and grow in importance. In business terms: there is a growing market in sustainable consumer goods and services, demonstrated in the sustainable product sales graph in the U.S (see below). Due to the pull of these end-consumers, through the whole B2B supply chain\u00a0the demand for more sustainable alternatives will rise . By measuring and reducing your carbon emissions, you can make scientifically supported and therefore credible statements about the sustainability performance of your company.\nSustainable products drive growth in both the US and the EU (Credit: Nielsen Company)\nConsumers are not the only stakeholders that are sensitive to the image of a company. According to Deloitte's Millennial surveys , employees not only care a lot about the environment but are more attracted to companies that are environmentally aware. Company sustainability has become a weapon of choice in the ongoing talent war. Employees that identify with the values of the company are more likely to stay on board and are more motivated .\nOn the investor side, there is increasing sustainability awareness. Oxford University found that more than 80% of mainstream investors now consider \u2018ESG\u2019 \u2013 environmental, social and governance \u2013 information when making investment decisions.\nThis means that emerging companies have a higher chance to access investments when integrating environmental indicators to their business plan. As an established enterprise, collecting environmental data would provide another lens to better understand productivity, product and market performances.\nWhere do I begin monitoring my carbon emissions?\nSo, how can a company get ahead of the curve? Plan A has developed an integrated solution for companies to reduce their environmental footprint and build a truly sustainable company culture.\nFirst, create an account on planA.earth and prepare your essential data.\nSecond, access your Emissions Dashboard to understand where your footprint comes from and what your priorities should be.\nThird, implement your tailored Sustainable Action Plan to reduce your emissions and offset with certified projects across the world.\nWhether you're starting your journey or are looking for better insights to engage your internal and external stakeholders, join the Plan A community and get on the green side of the fence!\nClick on the image to explore Plan A's offer\nThis article was written by Michelle Hallemans .

From international conferences to music festivals, attendees fly worldwide to attend highly anticipated events. With the event industry back in full bloom, its environmental impact inevitably keeps growing - making it imperative to decarbonise and rethink how we organise and execute gatherings. How can we continue this fruitful activity without the carbon cost?\nWhy events are a high emissions activity ?\nEvents have a substantial environmental impact, from production and transportation to waste. According to the University of Freiburg, each visitor causes an average of 0.5 to 1.5 tonnes CO 2 equivalents in a three-day conference. To achieve the Paris 1.5-degree target, each person worldwide must emit 2.5 tonnes of CO 2 equivalents annually by 2030. This demonstrates how carbon intensive an event can be and how important it is to decarbonise this activity.\nA recent study found that the travel-induced carbon footprint for international conferences results in more than 2,000 tonnes of greenhouse gases\u2014equivalent to what approximately 270 UK citizens emit in a whole year. The average participant produces between 500 and 1,500 kg CO 2 e per conference round-trip.\nFor music festivals, the picture is not getting brighter. Glastonbury generates 2,000 tons of waste in a weekend. A recent analysis found that 80% of Coachella's festival's carbon emissions come from attendees' travels . There is significant room for improvement and a dire need for systemic change.\u00a0\nTherefore, companies must monitor and reduce their event's carbon footprint. The GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard identifies events and conferences as a scope 3 activity that is not included in the list of scope 3 categories. It recommends that a public GHG emissions report have emissions from events and conferences and be reported separately from other scopes 3 types, such as in a section labelled \"other\" within the scope 3 category. Events and conferences represent significant emissions due to a myriad of reasons, from the high frequency of events, a large volume of attendees or large distances travelled by attendees.\nHow to organise a sustainable event?\nOn the 7th of July, Plan A launched a new event series named 'Sustainability Encounters'. The series gathers sustainability experts to discuss the innovations and applications that are helping us to transition to a net zero global economy. The events within this series cover different activities and categories that contribute to a business\u2019 carbon emissions. The first event within this series tackled how to decarbonise events. The event included a panel discussion with sustainability experts and a networking session alongside drinks and snacks for all attendees. As a team, we were dedicated to creating as sustainable an event as possible while monitoring the carbon emissions throughout the process. Finally, being transparent about these emissions inspires others to do the same.\u00a0\nMaking the world a better place, one event at a time.\nCredit: Plan A\nTo reduce the environmental impact of\u00a0 this physical event, we steered multiple decarbonisation efforts - feel free to implement these ideas for your next corporate event:\u00a0\n- Selection of a sustainable venue: the venue is locally based and close to transportation systems.\u00a0\n- Keep it local: All our speakers were based in Berlin, avoiding unnecessary business travel emissions.\u00a0\n- Go plastic free: We opted for tap water in a large glass water jug instead of plastic water bottles.\u00a0\n- Organic food and drinks: We provided climate-neutral wine and meat-free snacks.\u00a0\n- Eliminate paper: We chose beverages in a glass bottles that can be recycled with the Pfand system available in Germany.\n- Reducing packaging waste by renting reusable glass crockery instead of buying plastic or paper cups.\n- Upcycle and recycle: We provided separate waste bins in the event space with clear labels indicating precisely what to dispose of in each container.\n- Promote sustainable transportation: We Encouraged attendees to come to the event by foot, bike, or public transport.\n- Logistics: Use a car-sharing system to transport goods to and from the venue.\u00a0\nAdios plastic! Tap water in a jug is the answer.\nCredit: Plan A\nHow do we measure the carbon footprint of our events?\u00a0\nWe used our events module management to track the carbon emissions from our event, enabling us to calculate emissions activity automatically.\u00a0\nAttendees filled out our survey via a specific QR code.\nCredit: Plan A\nTo make our data accurate, we asked each participant to complete a short survey accessible through a QR code at the event to monitor commuting and accommodation emissions. Then, at the end of the event, we carefully weighed each bin per waste category. We also collected data on energy usage, logistics, production, and food and beverage choices to complete our analysis. Once we collected the data, we entered it into the platform, yielding the magic number we needed.\u00a0\nOur event's scope 3 emissions breakdown. The unit used is kg CO2e.\nCredit: Plan A\nAnd now the results you have been waiting for: our event's total carbon footprint is 633.26 kg CO 2 e. By analysing our data, we realised that our most significant source of emissions was from:\n- Catering: 407.15 kg CO 2 e\n- Commute from attendees: 159.15 kg CO 2\n- Logistics (transportation of goods to & from the venue): 32.26 kg CO 2 e\n- Accommodation of attendees: 18.08 kg CO 2 e\nThe lowest emissions activity accounted for were:\u00a0\n- Waste: 1.59 kg CO 2 e\n- Heating (as the event occurred during the summer): 4.57 kg CO 2 e\nLearnings from our sustainable events\nThe panel discussion gave us great insights into organising sustainable events.\n\u274c Switching \"unsustainable\" materials for greener ones is not always a win-win situation. For example, attendees must use tote bags 74 times before becoming more environmentally friendly than simple plastic bags.\n\u2705 Do more with less: Giveaway plants instead of merchandise or eliminate them altogether.\n\u2705 Build your sustainability progressively, but holistically. It's OK to not have all details entirely decarbonised, but make sure to be transparent about what you have or haven't done. Pretending it's all sustainable when it is not will not cut it to your audience and for your brand.\n\u274c The most significant source of carbon emissions for events are travel and catering.\n\u2705 Encourage people to use public transport, carpooling, biking or walking if possible.\n\u2705 It is about what you eat and less where your food comes from provide vegetarian or vegan meals, think of zero waste packaging and compost the rest of the food waste.\nStart your events' decarbonisation with Plan A.

Scientists, governments, policy-makers and individuals now understand the necessity for our systems to shift towards a decarbonised, resilient and resource-efficient economy to mitigate climate change and prepare for more significant impacts.\nOn the other hand, there is a growing awareness that finance and businesses are critical enablers in this transition. By shifting investments and \u201cputting money where our mouths are\u201d, we can build an economy that promotes sustainability. According to the OECD, \u20ac 6.35 trillion a year is needed to meet the Paris Agreement by 2030 - the mobilisation of institutional and private capital will have to be unprecedented in speed and direction.\nThe European Union is taking a leading role in this transition by introducing the EU Taxonomy Regulation . It is the first time that a legal document provides a standard and global definition of sustainable economic activities and aims to prevent greenwashing . The Taxonomy regulation is affecting investors and businesses in the EU and beyond its borders - making it critical for financial institutions and companies to align their activities.\nTo make your deep dive on the topic easier, Plan A has compiled an exclusive Whitepaper on the EU Taxonomy.

Every day, consumers get bombarded with new information regarding corporate sustainability initiatives:\u00a0McDonald's banning plastic straws , Coca-Cola using\u00a050% recycled materials in their packaging,\u00a0and so on. As consumers, we may question, however, whether or not these companies are honestly addressing the pressing environmental issues linked to their business activities.\u00a0\nAs global consumers increasingly become more \"environmentally-conscious,\" brands capitalise on the growing demand for sustainable products and services. Why? Brands see an economic benefit in doing so. But are companies who claim to be sustainable actually sustainable ? Are they selling us a dream or a reality ? This article explains how to spot greenwashing and how to avoid it.\nWhat is Greenwashing?\nIt is vital first to understand the definition of greenwashing. It is not as easy as throwing a t-shirt in the washing machine and letting it turn green. According to the\u00a0Cambridge dictionary , \"greenwashing\" is an\u00a0attempt to make people believe that your company is doing more to protect the environment than it is.\u00a0In other words, greenwashing is purely misleading consumers. It does not help pave the way to a sustainable future.\u00a0Greenwashing: Little green lies\nLincoln Star Journal, 2018.\nIt\u2019s not always as easy to spot a liar (Credit: Plan A)\nJay Westerveldemerged coined the term \" greenwashing \" in 1986, following the \" save the towel \" movement in the hotel industry. What hotels were doing was placing a notice in rooms asking guests to reuse their towels in order to protect the environment. In reality, the hotel just benefited from lower laundry costs. Products and services are greenwashed through massive marketing and PR strategies : rebranding, renaming, repackaging. Greenwashing is all about the idea that products are \"chemical-free,\" \"from natural origins,\" and more sustainable than their competitors.\nLittle gestures or little change? (Credit: Plan A)\nGreenwashing is the essence of \"anti-sustainable.\" Marketing strategies suck up air time and press corners, taking well-intentioned consumers down the wrong path. At the same time, environmental plights like ocean pollution and air pollution are stagnant or getting worse. In general, companies spend more money and time making the \"we are sustainable\" claim than they do implementing actual responsible business practices.\nRead more: What are scope 1,2 and 3 emissions?\nHow to Identify Greenwashing\nWith numerous companies worldwide surfing the \"green-sustainable wave,\" how can we (as consumers) spot greenwashing? How can we make the right sustainable choices? Firstly, we can check ourselves via \" the seven\u00a0sins of greenwashing ,\" established by TerraChoice. This study on environmental claims helps consumers to detect greenwashing.\nIt\u2019s better to take a closer look at impact (Credit: Plan A)\nThe Sins of Mister Greenwashing\nLet's start with the Bible tenets on Greenwashing. The \" sin of no proof \" corresponds to an ecological claim with no scientific evidence, easily accessible supporting information, or support from verified third parties. So, as a sustainable soldier, it is your job to genuinely verify the claims companies make using facts and details. (e.g. transparent supply chain, life-cycle analysis)\u00a0\nNext, a \"hidden trade-off \" occurs when companies label a product as sustainable based on a small set of attributes, (e.g. bottle made out of 70% recycled plastic) while at the same time leaving other characteristics aside. (e.g. carbon emissions released, energy used during the manufacturing process, transportation method) Unfortunately, many companies need to learn more about life-cycle and sustainability accounting 101 . When a business claims: \"our products are made are from recycled-materials,\" we must ask ourselves, as consumers: \"through which processes are these products made, from which materials are they produced, how are they disposed of?\"\nLastly, the \" sin of vagueness \" is described as the use of \"fluffy-language\" that resonates like an empty shell. Terms like \"all-natural\" or \"eco-friendly\" are vague and do not represent a product's environmental impact. Often misunderstood by consumers, vague attributes are not necessarily sustainable. An example: product components like Mercury and arsenic are 'natural' but still poisonous.\nThe Green Trap\nIt is also important not to fall into the\u00a0green visuals\u00a0trap (e.g. flowers blooming, trees) or fall for eco-responsible logos. These types of subjective images do not support any sustainable claims and mislead a consumer's consciousness. For example, a beautiful green shampoo bottle with bamboo pictures and containing \"natural argan oil\" seems to be sustainable. Wait until you read the ingredient list, however, which likely only a Harvard medical student could make sense of: \" \u2022\u00a0Ethylhexyl palmitate \u2022 ppg-14 butyl ether\u00a0\u2022ammonium acryloyldimethyltaurate.\"\n\"False labels \" are also a key component of greenwashing. A false label is a 'certification' by third parties that do not exist, or a completely fake certification label. There is also \" fibbing ,\" which is advertising that makes flat-out false claims. (A company saying \"we are Rainforest certified,\" for instance, and it not being true)\nLook aboot ye! Don\u2019t fall for the trap of greenwashing\nAn Example of Greenwashing: the Fiji Water Case\nWe are all familiar with the plastic water bottle brand \" Fiji .\" Fiji has used product placement with Hollywood celebrities and \"water untouched by man\" advertising to increase its market shares. Fiji has positioned itself as a sustainable brand and a \"carbon-negative\" product. When we examine the environmental impacts of plastic bottled water, this is quite surprising.\u00a0\nFiji water was living the \"green life\" until the California-based Newport Trial Group\u00a0filed a lawsuit against their false claims . The defendants claimed they removed more CO 2 from the atmosphere than they emitted, making them carbon-negative. The brand justified their case by\u00a0operating a discredited carbon accounting method\u00a0known as \" forward crediting .\" In other words, they did not remove more carbon emissions than they released. They claim credits for carbon reduction that may or may not take place up to several decades in the future.\nHere is an explanatory video on the Greenwashing behind Fiji Water:\n\u200d Wondering how to not make the Greenwashing mistake?

From soon-to-be-born babies to the most influential CEOs of this planet, and from the last uncontacted indigenous tribes of the Amazon to the bustling centre of Kigali in Rwanda, climate change - or its more positive counterpart sustainable transition - is everybody\u2019s business.\nSustainability has been at the centre of debates for longer than we'd think. River conservation is a good example of how old resource management really is (regulations on river pollution and halieutic resources are among the oldest recorded international treaties and laws).\u00a0\nBut who decides on what? Climate change touches upon all aspects of society because it affects the stage at which everything else happens. If we were to categorise these stakeholders of climate change,\nThe groups that influence climate change policy\nThe First Conference on Climate Change was held in 1979\nGovernmental bodies stand with the most levees at their command. With legally binding power and the strength to enforce these decisions, governments are expected to give priority to the greater good. With the dismantling of nothing short of avant-garde projects in the French ZAD of Notre-Dame-des-Landes, the promotion of industrial and destructive agricultural practices.\nHistorically, modern states have given their priority to the economic exploitation of nature - to the detriment of other key indicators of success such as health, durability or quality. The example of fossil fuel subsidies stands out as a failure of our recent governments to step away from their addiction to fossil sources of energy. What governments decide on doing with this influence and power is mostly up to electoral and social dynamics. The vocal critics of public collective action are not backed by historical evidence, given the prevalence of social movements in obtaining welfare and environmental victories.\nCivil society , made up of non-governmental organisations, private citizens, informal groups, weigh in on the debate/decision-makers by making their voices heard and by swaying the public opinion in their favour. Through a motley multitude of actions and channels, these stakeholders have been able to reorient governments\u2019 priorities, funds and agendas.\nFor example, it wasn\u2019t until a massive push from environmental activists that nuclear testing in the Pacific was declared illegal, or that the international ivory trade became off-limit for all countries. Civil society holds formidable power and acts not only as of the moral conscience of our societies but also as a reservoir of innovation and solutions waiting to be tried, tested and made better.\nA company can also be great guys.\nCredit: Woodwork Academy\nCompanies and the private sector have been the vehicles of creating economic value in society. The general influence of business has grown steadily since at least the XIVth century. This influence has grown in parallel with the rise of merchants and traders as the locus of power and away from noble families and the decline of military might as the sole key to society\u2019s high ranks.\u00a0\nIt is incumbent on these stakeholders to provide prosperity, opportunities and create wealth. As for governmental bodies, companies monitor very closely the reactions of their customers and are dependent on them to ensure their success. This has led to an interesting evolution. Impact marketing relies on the usage of values and political standpoints as a sale point for a product or a service.\u00a0\nCompanies hold the majority of the world\u2019s operational capacities, whether in the form of money or structures. Supply chains that unify humanity in one big lovely mess come from these stakeholders, and the largest companies have the potential to transform entire industries in one decision. Consequently, they are also the ones to bear a larger part of the responsibility of climate change and pollution. A recent audit found that14% of branded pollution - pollution that can be traced to a producer - come from the top 3 polluting brands: Coca-Cola, Pepsico and Danone.\nWhat about the role of the individual against climate change?\nWho is more responsible then, the consumer or the producer? When we finally solve this infinite riddle - if we ever do - it will be too late. What the world needs now is concerted action among all these stakeholders of climate change. After all, they do share the proverbial objective of saving the planet.\nNot everyone comes to this issue/opportunity from the same perspective. From the get-go, there are inherent different standpoints between - and among - these stakeholders. It is not hard to see how a small-scale peasant from a rural area of India sees the allowance of water differently from Coca-Cola Corp . In turn, it is fair for a wheat farmer or a power plant to benefit from more water resources than a family because they are using it for necessary activities. But how does this influence the free flow of, say, rainbow trouts that are at the centre of a local native population\u2019s culture and way of life?\nIndividuals are distinct from all the previous groups in the sense that they are the first indivisible unit that makes up all the subsequent ones. Each individual is also a voter, a professional, a colleague, a member of all these previous bodies and arenas. In the end, all social structures - from board game appreciation group to family to company to government - are made up of individuals, where made by individuals, and only exist because enough individuals believe in them. All in all, it falls on the shoulders of each citizen-individual-boss. Plan A works with all these individuals to empower them in the different circles they act in.

On the other side, billionaires and philanthropists are leading the decarbonisation revolution: from Bill Gates promising to cool the earth with solar engineering technology, to Elon Musk obsessed with electric cars (just a heads up: Tesla gained USD $1.4 billion in 2020 selling carbon credits ). You will understand it: decarbonisation is everywhere and in everyone's mouth - but truly what does it mean? And is it going to save us from climate doomsday?\nDecarbonisation is the key factor in alleviating climate change, the goal is simple: limiting carbon dioxide emissions, around the world, as soon as possible . This process requires both sweeping change and incremental steps: from sector to sector, from industry to industry. Even if the energy sector is the most scrutinized one, with renewable energies being more affordable - other industries shall be focused on: cement, steel, agriculture, and many more. Decarbonisation is not an easy path and will require billions of investments - but with global companies active involvement, we might get there.\nWhat is decarbonisation?\nBy definition, decarbonisation is the process of removing or reducing all man-made carbon emissions, with the goal to eliminate them altogether - reaching net-zero emissions . According to the Oxford dictionary, \"decarbonisation is the process of replacing\u00a0fossil fuels\u00a0with fuel that is less harmful to the environment\". In that sense, decarbonisation is achieved by implementing low-carbon technologies and energy sources (e.g. renewable energies, regenerative agriculture, electrical grid, hydrogen).\nOn the other hand, a decarbonised economy or \"low-carbon\" economy is the conversion to an economy using low-carbon energy sources, reducing the amount of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) released in the atmosphere. Decarbonisation is often applied to a country's economy and is achieved by targeting the most carbon-intensive industries in this specific country and finding innovative solutions to cut carbon emissions.\nThe concept of decarbonisation arises from the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement - intending to limit global warming well below 2\u00b0C\u00a0above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5\u00b0C . To reach this ambitious goal, countries have to cut GHG emissions rapidly, to reach\u00a0carbon-neutrality by 2030 , and net-zero emissions by 2050. And, this is where, my dear Watson, decarbonisation comes into play. We must now agree on a binding review mechanism under international law, so that this century can credibly be called a century of decarbonisation.\nAngela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany\nWith only ten years remaining on the Paris Agreement, it would require an 80 to 90 per cent reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions to meet the Paris target. These targets cannot be reached without decarbonising industrial activities. Decarbonisation is what will enable countries and companies all over the world, to come to net-zero emissions.\nWhy is decarbonisation important for companies?\nDecarbonisation is a global imperative for governments, businesses and society because it plays a crucial role to limit the worst effects of climate change. While many companies declared becoming carbon-neutral by 2050, recent estimates suggest we are not on track to meet the Paris targets - more must be achieved, and at a greater speed.\nKey characteristics of decarbonisation pathways, based on Luderer et al. (2018) .\nWB-2C: well below 2 \u00b0C scenarios.\nFor companies, decarbonisation means the complete reduction of carbon emissions , on all scopes of carbon emissions . Each company must establish a decarbonisation strategy in line with its industry . Then, it is essential for a company to evaluate the number of emissions it is directly or indirectly responsible for as a result of its business operations, and to then identify the options for reducing them. Further, decarbonisation will require a radically different energy system, by adopting alternative energy sources based\u00a0on green power and green molecules (such as biofuels and hydrogen).\nGlobal CO2 Emissions per sector\nSource: IPCC (2014) & EEA (2018)\nAs stated before, the race to decarbonising companies has begun. The Intergovernmental Group of the International Energy Agency predicts that new patents in key technology like batteries, hydrogen, intelligent grids and carbon capture greatly outweigh the patents in other technologies, including fossil fuels.\nHow to decarbonise companies?\nDecarbonisation = business opportunity\nDecarbonising companies must be seen as a business opportunity - by investing in this solution, your business will reap all of the benefits. Rethinking business' operations enable innovation: from reusing carbon as an output for products, reducing raw materials to find alternatives to consumption habits. For example, Impossible Foods - which makes low-carbon alternative protein - is valued at $10bn.\nUnderstand your corporate carbon footprint\nThen, it is all about understanding your corporate carbon footprint (CCF) . According to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, by switching to renewable energy we will cut greenhouse gas emissions only by 55%,\u00a0the remaining\u00a045 % of emissions\u00a0come from making and using products and how we produce food. By assessing it, companies can identify their largest sources of energy usage, production intensity, transportation needs and waste generated across processes.\nCarbon footprint monitoring allows companies to identify sources and opportunities for carbon reduction. Knowing that one's carbon footprint comes from scope 3 (indirect sources), companies will find a sea of opportunities there. For example, World IT leader Atos told us that 50% of its carbon footprint comes from computers - applicable to scope 3. To decarbonise, Atos is engaging actively with its suppliers to reduce its environmental impact and implement change. For that, the company has set up drivers to incentivise its suppliers.\nYou may then scale up your efforts by measuring your performance using open data sets against your competitors. Our carbon management platform helps many companies in establishing decarbonisation pathways. Book a demo now .\nDecarbonise the whole value-chain\nConsider how you can include carbon removal into your product strategy, supplier networks, and operations across your whole value chain , as well as create responsibility, particularly around emissions and science-based objectives. A significant part of carbon emissions may be eliminated by converting to renewable energy, electrification systems, and improving efficiency. In terms of energy sources, hydrogen, for example, may be used to decarbonize steel, shipping, bussing, and coal, among other industries.\nThe challenge is how to reach your goals after you understand your carbon footprint and have measures in place. With a plethora of digital, new material, and decarbonisation technologies at your disposal, you'll need to devise a plan that allows for large-scale impact while achieving maximum value.\nFor example, carbon-based feedstocks (waste) such as methane, agricultural leftovers may be converted into goods using innovative carbon technology solutions. For example, UBQ\u00a0transforms landfill waste into goods. For each tonne used and produced, approximately 1.3 tonnes of landfilled waste are diverted and up to 15 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent are saved in its current pilot commercial operations.\nEvaluate your decarbonisation strategy\nNow it is time to evaluate your strategy, and how much carbon you have reduced so far. Improve your decision-making constantly by using the right metrics, and go deeper into decarbonisation.\nNote: It is expected that investors will look deeply into companies' efforts in becoming net-zero emissions and climate risks' strategies. It is not out of the realm that businesses might be refuse loans or investments because of their \"dirty processes\". So, be one of the good girls and guys, start decarbonising your business now.\nDecarbonisation is challenging and requires accurate carbon data to ensure sustainable decision-making.

The exponential growth of ESG requirements and the importance of \u2018sustainability\u2019 means that the development of accurate and impactful ESG reports is ever-so crucial. The European Union\u2019s recent adoption of key laws to ensure they can reach their 2030 climate targets, and the influence of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) on over 10,000 foreign companies means that ESG reporting will continue to define the long-term success of companies and organisations of all sizes around the world.\u00a0\nNot only does ESG and sustainability reporting allow for transparency surrounding the environmental impact of an organisation, but this report also acts as a key lever for conversations to be initiated with key stakeholders. Furthermore, annual ESG reporting sets a baseline for organisations to measure changes against the future, whilst simultaneously allowing organisations to identify actions that could be taken to improve their ESG performance. Such ESG engagement has been found by Harvard to\u00a0 increase sales through improving customer loyalty and satisfaction.\nIn order to efficiently prepare an annual ESG report which meets international standards, and the demands of both internal and external stakeholders, organisations must ensure the following steps are closely considered:\n1. Determine the scope of the report\nFirstly, companies need to determine the contents of the report through evaluating the nature of ESG topics that are most relevant to the organisation, its stakeholders and reporting requirements. A materiality assessment is a useful tool which can be used to better understand which topics align with the ESG and sustainability strategy of an organisation, along with the topics required to ensure the development of an impactful report. Furthermore, industry benchmarking may be utilised as a tool to understand which topics, key performance indicators and reporting frameworks are most commonly used within the relevant industry and market of an organisation. Companies can utilise such information to ensure they can provide relevant data relating to their management and performance on ESG topics. \u200d\n2. Pursue alignment with reporting standards\nWhilst not obligatory, following third-party ESG reporting standards and frameworks is a key step that should be taken to ensure accuracy and efficiency within the preparation process. Frameworks, such as those developed by the Global Reporting Initiative ( GRI ) and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board ( SASB ), provide useful guidance on reporting material across a range of industries. Furthermore, these standards utilise robust and systematic disclosure processes that assist in making reports more accurate and comparable, thus increasing the value of these reports to the internal and external stakeholders of companies.\nA guide to the top ESG\u00a0reporting frameworks which companies should utilise within their net-zero journey.\nCredit: Plan A\n3. Develop a comprehensive report outline\nFollowing the assessment of which ESG issues will be included within the report and which reporting framework is most relevant, the next step is to develop a report outline. This outline should give a clear and sequential overview of the key elements which are to be included within the report. The outline may be structured around the key themes which are to be disclosed within the report, or it may follow the key pillars of the organisation's ESG strategy. Companies may then choose to develop a data inventory. A data inventory is built off the basis of the report outline and serves as a repository for all relevant ESG data that is to be included within the report, whilst also ensuring there are no gaps in data. \u200d\n4. Collect and evaluate data\nOnce an outline of the report has been developed, data and content pertaining to relevant ESG topics within the report should be collected. Sustainability officers and financial officers should work in collaboration whilst liaising with internal stakeholders and data owners to ensure the efficient collection of data used to reflect upon the ESG strategy of an organisation. To ensure quality and accuracy within key data points and metrics, the use of internal audits and external assurers is fundamental.\u00a0\nPlan A provides a comprehensive carbon accounting and decarbonisation platform that allows businesses to easily collect and streamline their emissions data, measure and analyse their carbon emissions, and report on their sustainability and ESG performance.\u00a0\nCredit: Plan A\n5. Prepare and design the report\nOnce all the required information has been gathered throughout the collection process; the content and narrative of the report should be drafted. The content of the report should clearly communicate the organisation\u2019s approach to their sustainability and ESG strategy, policies, management, and performance on key issues. Furthermore, internal stakeholders should be engaged (e.g. marketing or legal) to acquire approval across key areas such as content, language and tone of voice. Once the final draft of the report has been approved, it is essential that an internal marketing team or external graphic designer is assigned to ensure the report contains meaningful graphics (e.g. charts, graphs or tables) and is visually appealing to ensure the report is easy to draw insights from.\n6. Publish, reflect upon and improve ESG\u00a0performance\nFinally, once the final report is ready to be published - various communication channels, such as the company website, press releases and social media, should be leveraged to ensure all key stakeholders can easily access the ESG report. Following the publication of the report; organisations should debrief with their key stakeholders to reflect upon any gaps within their ESG strategy and reporting, areas where they can improve, and what commitments should be made moving forward.\nCompanies that wish to deliver impactful and transparent reports must therefore not only align their resources towards ESG reporting, they must incorporate sustainability as a central focus within their wider supply chain and operations. Effective and aligned reporting allows companies to set emission reduction targets, reduce their emissions through tailored plans, and communicate their progress. All this whilst undergoing continuous improvement and significantly contributing to several strategic performance measures - such as;\n- Cost savings: Mitigating the effects of climate change through ensuring compliance with ESG regulations helps companies cut costs.\n- Risk reduction: ESG and sustainability reporting allows organisations to gain a comprehensive understanding of their operations; thus ensuring environmental, social and financial risks can be minimised.\u00a0\n- Enhanced efficiency: The information-gathering related processes involved with reporting means companies will be able to enhance their decision making abilities, and thus their operational efficiency .\u00a0\n- Increased access to capital: With Oxford University finding that more than 80% of mainstream investors now consider ESG information when making investment decisions, transparency is increasingly important among both internal and external stakeholders. Therefore, ensuring the alignment of internal governance will be key to increasing the ease at which companies can access financial capital. \u200d\n- Improved brand image: As found by Nielsen , sustainable product sales have grown by nearly 20%\u00a0since 2014. Accordingly, consumers are evidently looking to support companies that are acting towards a more sustainable business model. As such, aligned ESG\u00a0reporting is a negotiable for businesses wishing to bolster their reputation. \u200d \u200d\n- \u200d Innovation: Defining areas of strength and weaknesses is key to unlocking opportunities for innovation.\nAccordingly,\u00a0the aforementioned guide should be closely considered at an organisational level to ensure that ESG reports are prepared and delivered in an efficient and effective manner. Utilising these steps as a guide and seeking continuous improvement within the areas of ESG and sustainability will allow companies to ascertain a competitive advantage through ensuring they are compliant with relevant regulations.\nIt is never too early to start preparing for the upcoming reporting period.

Whilst it may seem paradoxical, businesses are increasingly favouring the influence of regulations as they act as guidelines for best practice - particularly in relation to climate.\u00a0\nIn light of the upcoming reporting cycle and growing awareness surrounding the long-term value potential of embedding sustainability as a key component of corporate strategy; it is ever so important that businesses understand and account for the influence of various regulatory bodies and frameworks.\u00a0\nAccordingly, this article will outline several key ESG regulatory bodies, regulations & frameworks which affect businesses of all shapes and sizes. Furthermore, this article will detail the influence of regulatory bodies upon sustainable business practice; and finally, how businesses can utilise ESG regulations & frameworks to their advantage.\nSource:\u00a0Dun And Bradstreet\nThe current landscape of ESG regulations & frameworks\u00a0\nSome of the key regulations and frameworks which are of vital importance to organisations\u00a0include:\nTask Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\u00a0\nThe Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) was created in 2015 by the international Financial Stability Board (FSB) to develop consistent climate-related financial risk disclosures for use by companies, banks, and investors. The aim is to provide financial stability globally, as climate change will negatively impact our economy. The main objective of TCFD reporting is to disclose the climate-related risks and opportunities of a company as well as the financial impact those might have on the company's operations and business model. To learn more about reporting and this framework in particular, go here . \u200d\nCorporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)\nThe Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) is the new EU legislation requiring all large companies to publish regular reports on their environmental and social impact activities. It helps investors, consumers, policymakers, and other stakeholders evaluate large companies' non-financial performance. Thus, it encourages these companies to develop more responsible approaches to business. For instance, it radically changes companies' scope and type of sustainability reporting. With the CSRD, the European Commission defines a common reporting framework for non-financial data for the first time.\nNon-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD)\nThe Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) requires companies in scope to publish a non-financial report on their ESG performance together with their annual management report. The NFRD aims to help investors, civil society organisations, consumers, policy makers and other stakeholders to evaluate the non-financial performance of large companies and encourages these companies to develop a responsible approach to business.\nUK Disclosure Framework for Net Zero Transition Plans\nThe UK Disclosure Framework for Net Zero Transition Plans is a set of guidelines that companies can use to report on their efforts to transition to net zero emissions and support the transition to a low-carbon economy. The framework was developed by the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) , an organisation established by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to promote consistent and transparent reporting of climate-related risks and opportunities, as companies increasingly announce net zero commitments, without publishing plans to support their targets. It is part of the UK government\u2019s commitment to become the \u201cworld\u2019s first net zero-aligned financial centre\u201d.\nOn 8th November 2022 the UK\u2019s Transition Plan Taskforce (TPT) published their Disclosure Framework and Implementation Guidance .It draws on existing and emerging standards and recommendations, including the TCFD , the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) and the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) .\nCDP - A climate disclosure framework for SME\nCDP is a popular voluntary reporting framework that companies use to disclose environmental information to their stakeholders (investors, employees, and customers). The online response system is now open, and Wednesday the 26th of July 2023 is the deadline for businesses who wish to receive a CDP score.\nEU\u2019s Sustainable Finance Plans\nIn the EU's policy context, sustainable finance is understood as finance to support economic growth while reducing pressures on the environment and taking into account social and governance aspects.\nEU\u2019s \u201cFit for 55\u201d\nThe European Union's Fit for 55 package aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030. The European Commission proposed the package in July 2021; and in April 2023 , the EU parliament confirmed the revolutionary climate targets. The legislation comprises; an overhaul of the Emissions Trading System (ETS), the establishment of a parallel carbon market, and an \u20ac86.7 billion social climate fund. This groundbreaking legislation signals a global shift towards greener policies and ensures a more sustainable future for the EU and the world.\nThe influence of ESG regulations upon the sustainability of business practices\nClimate risk is financial risk.\u00a0\nThe continued growth of reporting standards on a global scale further emphasises such a statement, and is no surprise; such standards are critical to ensuring that there is an aligned assessment of the cost of climate change to both businesses and governments.\u00a0\n- Businesses who do not continually analyse the regulatory landscape thus risk engaging in business actions and reporting practices which do not comply with relevant policies.\n- As such, it is vital that businesses understand the relevant regulations which apply to them, the actions they must take to abide by such regulations, and which future regulations may influence them.\n- Businesses should seek voluntary frameworks to ensure they are creating impactful and effective reports, thus mitigating financial risk and increasing transparency amongst stakeholders.\n- Businesses who are proactive will hold the opportunity to become pioneers within the transition to a sustainable economy\u00a0\u00a0\nHow can businesses utilise ESG regulations and frameworks to strategically implement climate action?\nThe implementation of regulatory standards acts as a guide for business practice, influencing corporate climate action and guiding sustainable practice. Simultaneously, the provision of voluntary frameworks which companies may utilise as a guide within key areas - such as reporting - is no less important within the transition towards a more sustainable economy.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe implementation of such net-zero targets and frameworks have been found to be highly effective. Through further unifying the way companies and countries understand concepts around climate change, sustainability and decarbonisation, such frameworks facilitate the alignment of language and action. However, it must be noted that the majority of such frameworks focus on historical assessment, and with a further heating planet, reporting on the past won't help us prepare for the future.\nBusinesses can leverage the aforementioned regulations and frameworks to their advantage in various ways, such as:\n- Proactively ensuring compliance with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) through active monitoring and reporting measures, (e.g. data collection) to avoid significant sanctions.\n- For organisations reporting on the NFRD; understanding that the first CSRD report of companies in scope of NFRD is due in 2025 for the financial year of 2024. Given it is just a matter of time before the NFRD is replaced by the CSRD, businesses must seek information about the CSRD and how it impacts their company.\n- For businesses affected by the TCFD, understanding that companies with a calendar financial year will need to include the mandatory climate-related financial disclosures for the first time in their annual report and account for the financial year commencing on 1 January and ending on 31 December 2023 is of fundamental importance to ensuring sustainability is a strategic priority, whilst mitigating further financial risk.\n- Organisations should voluntarily utilise the UK Disclosure Framework for Net Zero Transition to take advantage of a consistent and transparent way to report on climate efforts, whilst actively accelerating the transition to net zero and supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy. The framework further provides investors, customers, and other stakeholders with the information they need to understand a company's efforts to address climate-related risks and opportunities. As such, the Uk disclosure framework provides immense value to those seeking to strategically leverage sustainability whilst actively contributing to the overall decarbonisation journey.\u00a0\n- Companies can utilise the CDP framework to further understand and report on the critical climate-related indicators SMEs should report on and use to inform their disclosures. Including this information in their mainstream reports or when using other data collection or reporting platforms will enable such companies to fulfil stakeholders\u2019 demands for transparency; map and understand risks within their supply chain; and to benchmark their performance within the ent-zero transition, thus enabling a competitive advantage.\n- Finally, reporting on climate risk and sustainability by understanding and ensuring compliance with various laws, such as the EU Climate Law, the EU Fit for 55, the EU Sustainable Finance Plan and Germany\u2019s Climate Protection Act.\nUltimately, sustainability needs to become the global standard across the supply chains of globalised businesses in order to reach vital long-term climate goals, such as the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals .\u00a0 As such, regulatory bodies and frameworks are absolutely crucial in minimising financial and environmental costs faced by governments, businesses, and wider society.\nSuch regulations provide clear guidelines for sustainable practice, thus ensuring that businesses are informed of the requirements they must meet to avoid sanctions, what actions they should take to embed sustainable practices, and therefore how businesses can allocate their resources to positively contribute to the overall journey towards decarbonisation.\nAccordingly, the continuation of ESG regulation means that businesses must take immediate action to ensure they are accurately monitoring and reporting on their non-financial performance, whilst also taking active steps towards decarbonisation.\n\u200d Future-proof your business through ensuring alignment with ESG regulations.

Global efforts to address climate change are especially apparent with the increasing implementation of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emission regulations - illustrated via taxes, emissions trading schemes (EMTs) and fossil fuel extraction fees. Having been implemented in over 40 countries and 20 cities and regions, carbon prices are imminently becoming an effective tool to aid the transformation of our global economy.\nCarbon dioxide (or CO 2 ) is a colourless, odourless gas consisting of one part carbon and two parts oxygen. CO 2 is a natural component of our planet's atmosphere and is one of the most common greenhouse gases. It is released through human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, but also by natural processes.\nBecause humanity releases more carbon dioxide - primarily through burning fossil fuels like coal and oil - into the atmosphere than current biological processes can remove, the amount and concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and ocean increases yearly. There are other greenhouse gases beyond carbon dioxide, such as methane (CH 4 ), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), or fluorinated gases (F-gases).\nCarbon emissions (or greenhouse gas emissions) release carbon into the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas emitted through human activities.\nWhat is carbon pricing?\nCarbon pricing is a popular mechanism that uses market drivers to address climate change action, by creating financial incentives for lowering carbon emissions or other gases such as methane and nitrous oxide that contribute to rising global temperatures. In a nutshell, carbon prices cover a part of a country\u2019s total emissions, charging C0 2 emitters for each ton released\u2019.\nNot to be confused with carbon offsetting; carbon pricing plays a vital role through utilising market mechanisms to establish financial incentives that encourage the reduction of emissions. Accordingly, carbon pricing primarily takes place in the form of a fee, tax, or a cap-and-trade system; depending on government allotments or permits. Through establishing financial limitations and incentives, companies face immense pressure to restructure their processes to guarantee a reduction in carbon emissions, either via transitioning to sustainable fuels or more efficient processes.\nIn summary, carbon pricing utilises market mechanisms to establish financial incentives that encourage the reduction of emissions.\nCarbon prices take place in various forms, these are the main types:\nCarbon Tax or Carbon Fee : A system where the government sets a price that carbon emitters must pay in line with each unit of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions they emit.\nEmission Trading System (ETS) : A permit system for GHG emissions which essentially sets a limit on emitted carbon emissions per company annually. Accordingly, the company in question is given a set allowance or they have to purchase the right to emit carbon. In doing so, companies that do not exceed their limit may choose to sell their \u2018unused\u2019 carbon emissions. Such a system is currently used across the European Union and thus sets a limit on GHG emissions, particularly in energy-intensive industries (e.g. oil, gas, steel, aviation).\nEmission Reduction Funds : A system, which is currently utilised within Australia, which incorporates taxpayer funded schemes whereby a government buys credits created by emission reduction projects.\nCap-and-trade System : A system whereby the government defines an emissions cap, and from this a quantity of emission allowances are issued in line with that cap.\nInternal Company Carbon Tax : A system where companies set a price for the pollution levels of their products, departments and/or regions in order to align all employees with broad net-zero targets.\nGlobal carbon pricing map.\nSource:\u00a0Climate Bonds\nHow is the price of carbon calculated?\nSo, how is carbon calculated and what does this mean?\nThrough capturing the external costs of carbon emissions, specifically the costs faced by the general public from climate related events, this cost can be placed back at its source. For instance, calculating the costs associated with events such as losses of property due to rising sea levels, losses of crops due to varied weather events, or the health costs associated with climate disasters, the costs of emitting carbon can be quantified.\nThere are various different models and studies to advise policy makers in relation to calculating carbon prices, as they are heavily dictated by the nature of the industry, the level of pollution, along with the wider net-zero goals of the particular country in question.\nAccordingly, the following guide has been provided by the World Bank to illustrate the fundamental principles which underpin effective and successful carbon pricing:\n- Fairness - Leading with a \u2018polluter pays\u2019 mentality and ensuring that both costs and benefits are equitably shared.\n- Policy alignment - Ensuring that carbon pricing is implemented in conjunction with broader climate and non-climate policy goals.\n- Stability - Ensuring that a clear, consistent and predictable policy framework is in place is key to facilitating a stable system with consistent messaging.\n- Transparency - Ensuring transparency surrounding the carbon calculation methodology and goals that underpin an industry or country\u2019s net-zero journey.\n- Cost-efficiency - Making sure that the framework meets the necessary return-on-income and is cost effective.\n- Reliability - Guaranteeing that the price calculation methodology does not undergo extreme fluctuation.\n- Integrity - Ensuring that the carbon price fits within the broader sustainability and net-zero agenda is an extremely important consideration.\nCarbon price as of April, 2021.\nSource:\u00a0World Bank\nUnderstandably, there are some key challenges that arise when calculating and implementing carbon pricing policies. These challenges include the presence of poorly designed policies, confusing policy overlaps, the ineffective utilisation of revenues obtained from carbon prices, and the risk of carbon leakage.\nCarbon leakage is an issue that arises primarily within global companies when they transfer production to countries with less emission constraints, thus meaning emissions were \u2018exported\u2019, and whilst the company appears more sustainable, the damage to the planet remains. This challenge can be addressed via the implementation of a strong carbon-pricing framework.\nEstimated CO2 emission reduction post carbon tax.\nSource:\u00a0Nomura\nThe influence of carbon pricing upon global decarbonisation\nCarbon pricing ultimately plays a crucial role within the global journey towards decarbonisation due to the vast influence that carbon pricing frameworks exert upon emission reduction.The importance of carbon pricing is reflected through:\n- Higher carbon prices hold the potential to improve profit margins for clean energy generation in Europe, including wind, solar, and nuclear power plants.\n- Carbon prices encourage investment in new technologies, such as carbon capture. Meanwhile, average carbon prices are set to potentially increase more than sevenfold to US $120\u00a0per metric ton by 2030.\n- Based upon S&P Dow Jones Indices, carbon pricing could lead to significant costs for companies, amounting to as much as US $1.3 trillion.\nIn summary, markets and governments setting carbon prices, and charging CO 2 emitters via a tax or fee, is fundamental to ensuring the burden of CO 2 emissions are placed on those who are most responsible. Whilst corporate social and environmental responsibility remains a key concern for businesses, the assessment of a business\u2019 environmental footprint is increasingly becoming a crucial performance factor.\nTherefore, it is imperative for companies and their stakeholders to account for carbon pricing risk within their operations in order to reduce their corporate carbon footprint.\nSee how monitoring and reducing carbon emissions can benefit your business.

Due to the technical tracking challenge,\u00a0 companies tend to focus on scopes 1 & 2 of emissions - relating to fuel and electricity. Nonetheless, the third scope of emission - indirect emissions - represents between 60 and 90% of a company's emissions . This is where companies' decarbonisation efforts should be concentrated. Plan A is proud to introduce three new modules: events management, waste, and business travel , to support companies in analysing and reducing their carbon emissions drastically.\nWe'll look back at our recent feature releases at the end of each quarter and share some insights. Without further ado, here are some of the best features on the Plan A platform in the first quarter of 2022.\n\ud83c\udf9f Hybrid event calculator\nWith the easing of Corona measures, hybrid and physical events are back - with corona born virtuals, ones are here to stay. According to the University of Freiburg, each visitor causes an average of 0.5 to 1.5 tonnes of CO 2 equivalents in a three-day conference. To achieve the Paris 1.5-degree target, each person worldwide would have to emit 2.5 tonnes of CO 2 equivalents annually by 2030. This example shows how essential event emissions are measured and how significant it is to reduce them.\u00a0\nLearn more about virtual events: Calculate the environmental impact of virtual events\nWhat does it do? The Hybrid Event calculator allows you to measure your hybrid events' emissions , including in-person and remote sessions. The automated calculation lets you fill in your details into the predefined fields - easing the pain associated with data collection and covering all aspects from events management to carbon accounting.\nOverview of the event management dashboard: simply insert your event's details and we take care of the rest!\nCredit: Plan A\nWhy is it useful? This calculator is the latest addition to our events calculator family, including the fully remote and physical events modules. The hybrid event module mixes both formats, as this event is becoming more common. Now you'll easily be able to track emissions for all event formats that your company is hosting.\u00a0\u00a0\nHow does it work? The data collection phase is split into simple steps, covering basic event information, energy usage, and travel modes. Our platform will guide you through the tool. Once the data collection is complete, you will be able to see that data in your 'Event emissions' dashboard.\n\u267b\ufe0f Waste management\nWhy does it matter? According to Eurostat , waste is the fourth most significant source of emissions in the EU. Respectively, in 2050, the world will generate 3.4 billion tonnes of waste per year . Therefore, companies must disclose this primary source of emissions to accurately cover all of their emissions.\nWhat does it do? The waste emissions module allows you to add and oversee operational waste data for different waste categories, giving you insight into your Scope 3 Category 5 emissions .\nOverview of waste emissions dashboard Credit: Plan A\nWhy is it useful? It will allow you to see what type of waste has the highest emissions, enabling you to make more informed decisions for reduction. You can also track your waste emissions over time, as a whole and per category, to see the results of your reduction actions.\nHow does it work? As the user, simply input the amount of waste in kilograms. Plan A now makes it possible to include collecting data from various waste categories \u2013 including five types of waste : plastic, paper, glass, organic, and residual waste \u2013 in the platform, thus creating visibility for the emissions in this sector and initiating targeted measures to reduce waste.\n\ud83d\ude86 Business travel\nWhy does it matter? Business travel is increasing as the world transitions out of a global pandemic. Plan A's upgraded business travel module lets data be uploaded to the platform either following our data collection wizard or bulk upload. Distance-based emissions calculation methods are also supported to ensure the high accuracy of emissions calculations. By flexibly adding departure and arrival locations for a business trip, the Business Travel module automatically calculates the distance travelled and the resulting carbon emissions based on the transport type. The dashboard then provides an overview of all business trips and their respective emissions.\nWhat does it do? The Business Travel module covers Scope 3 Category 6 emissions, allowing users to gather data for all business trips taken for the company. Once uploaded, you'll be able to see all trips organised in a table format, with high-level data visualised in graphs on your business travel emissions dashboard.\nA journey in business travel's data collection: download a template or upload your CSV file.\nCredit: Plan A\nWhy is it useful? As a user, you will get a clear picture of emissions per type of transport (flights, road, rail, ship) over time and the distance travelled for these journeys. Businesses can implement company-wide actions to reduce emissions across categories with this information. For example, this could be a policy to encourage train travel for trips under 500km.\nHow does it work?\u00a0\n- Each trip's data is fed into the platform with our downloadable template using the manual input or CSV upload. Data collection covers several areas, such as date, type of transport, arrival/departure dates and the number of employees travelling.\u00a0\n- Our platform automatically calculates the distance travelled and the resulting carbon emissions using distance-based emissions calculations based on the transport type. Additionally, these emissions will correspond to a specific month, quarter or year in your emissions dashboard.\nAre you not measuring your carbon emissions yet?

One area where companies can make a significant impact is by reducing emissions in their offices. From energy-efficient technologies to sustainable transportation options, there are a multitude of strategies that businesses can implement to reduce their environmental impact.\nIn this article, we'll explore some of the most innovative and effective ways to reduce office emissions, helping you create a more sustainable workplace while also driving cost savings and improving employee well-being.\u00a0\nWhy reduce emissions for your office?\u00a0\nBeitou Library, Taiwan's first green library, features solar panels, rainwater collection, and energy-saving wooden balcony railings. (Credit: Beitou Library)\nBefore we dive into the specifics of how to reduce emissions, let's take a closer look at why it is essential to do so.\nFirst and foremost, reducing emissions is crucial for preserving the environment. The burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas releases carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which contributes to warming of the planet and subsequent climate change. By reducing emissions, we can slow down the pace of global warming and meet global net-zero targets, under the Paris Agreement.\n\u200d\nTo put this into perspective, nearly 40% of carbon emissions related to energy usage worldwide come from buildings, contributing to a staggering 33% of global GHG emissions , while homes make up almost 20% of this total. These emissions from buildings result from two main factors. The first is the daily operation of a building, including the energy required for lighting, heating, or cooling homes, office buildings, and shopping centres. The second factor contributing to emissions from buildings is the materials used in constructing them. The production of building materials, such as cement, steel, and glass, requires significant amounts of energy and releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Additionally, the demolition and disposal of buildings at the end of their life cycle is a contributing factor.\nUltimately reducing emissions isn't just good for the environment, it can significantly benefit your business and improve ROI. For one, it can save you money on energy costs. Knowing that around 80% of the buildings we have today will exist in 2050 , we must retrofit them for energy efficiency. By reducing your energy consumption, you can lower your utility bills and increase your bottom line. Additionally, reducing emissions can improve your company's reputation and attract environmentally conscious customers. This customer base is growing exponentially as 84% of customers say that poor environmental practices will alienate them from a brand or company.\nTo address the issue of carbon emissions from buildings, several approaches can be taken. One is to improve the energy efficiency of buildings through measures such as insulation, efficient lighting and appliances, and renewable energy sources. Another approach is to reduce the carbon footprint of building materials by using recycled or sustainable materials, and designing buildings to be easily deconstructed and reused at the end of their life cycle.\nStatistics show that offices have a significant share of a company\u2019s footprint\n- According to the International Energy Agency , commercial and residential buildings account for 36% of global final energy consumption and nearly 40% of total CO 2 emissions.\n- In the UK, commercial buildings account for approximately 18% of the country's total carbon footprint .\n- The energy used in offices is responsible for over 60% of their greenhouse gas emissions .\n- The buildings sector is a key contributor to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, representing 35% of energy-related EU emissions in 2023. To reach net-zero targets energy consumption in buildings must drop by 25% compared with today , and fossil fuel use must decrease by more than 40%, together with a complete phase-out of the polluting traditional use of biomass by 2030.\n- A typical office building in Europe consumes between 200-300 kWh/m\u00b2 per year, while low-energy buildings consume less than 50 kWh/m\u00b2 per year.\nDifferent decarbonisation actions to take to reduce offices' emissions\nWe understand the problem, now let\u2019s focus on the solutions to reduce emissions in offices:\n- Use energy-efficient lighting : Using energy-efficient lighting such as LED bulbs, CFL or T5 fluorescent can save up to 75% of energy compared to traditional incandescent bulbs. According to the US Department of Energy, businesses can save up to $0.06 per square foot per year by using energy-efficient lighting.\n- Optimise heating and cooling systems : Optimising heating and cooling systems with programmable thermostats, clean filters, and energy-efficient HVAC systems can save energy and reduce emissions. A well-maintained HVAC system can reduce energy consumption by up to 30%.\u00a0\n- Reduce paper usage: Encouraging the use of digital documents and reducing paper usage can help reduce emissions. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, paper production and disposal account for 40% of waste in landfills.\u00a0\n- Encourage sustainable transportation : Encouraging sustainable transportation options such as public transportation, carpooling, biking, and walking can make a huge impact in reducing emissions from employee commuting. In fact, transportation accounts for 17% of global greenhouse gas emissions.\n- Choose sustainable suppliers and products: Choosing sustainable suppliers and products can help reduce emissions throughout the supply chain. This can include using recycled materials, reducing packaging, and selecting products with low-carbon footprints.\n- Retrofit existing buildings : Retrofitting existing buildings with energy-efficient measures such as insulation, energy-efficient windows, and renewable energy systems can reduce emissions. A report by C40 Cities revealed retrofitting existing buildings with energy-efficient measures could reduce their carbon emissions by up to 50% by 2030.\n- Use green certifications: Using green certifications such as LEED, BREEAM, or WELL to design and operate sustainable buildings can greatly reduce emissions. Buildings with green certifications have been found to emit 34% less carbon dioxide , use 25% less energy, and consume 11% less water than non-certified buildings, according to the US Green Building Council.\u00a0\n- Implement a sustainability policy: Implementing a sustainability policy and engaging employees in sustainable practices is a sure way to reduce emissions.\nReducing emissions in office buildings is essential for mitigating the impact of climate change. The carbon footprint of office buildings can be reduced through energy-efficient measures, sustainable transportation options, and choosing sustainable suppliers and products. Retrofitting existing buildings with energy-efficient measures and designing and operating sustainable buildings with green certifications can also significantly reduce emissions. By taking action to reduce their carbon footprint, offices can contribute to the fight against climate change while also benefiting financially and attracting environmentally conscious customers and employees.\nTake action today to reduce emissions for your office and contribute to a more sustainable future.

This expansion has resulted in a substantial increase in cross-border shipments throughout the European Union (EU), with cross-border online retail expanding by 17% in 2022, equating to a market value of \u20ac171 billion.\nAlthough the environmental impact of e-commerce businesses is generally lower than that of traditional retail businesses, the production, packaging, and distribution of this escalating volume of goods emit considerable levels of greenhouse gases. Consequently, it is crucial for e-commerce companies to utilise their influence to decarbonise their supply chains while contributing to a more sustainable online retail landscape.\nThe carbon footprint of e-commerce\nE-commerce is typically perceived to be an industry with a low environmental impact due to its online presence, yet these businesses ultimately rely upon carbon-intensive services to create and distribute goods to consumers. The vast popularity of e-commerce in such a short period, accounting for over 18% of retail sales worldwide, therefore inevitably relies heavily on the transportation and logistics industry, which is the largest carbon emitter in the United States - accounting for 29% of greenhouse gases (GHG).\u00a0\nAverage CO2 equivalent released per product sold\nWhilst the carbon emissions associated with e-commerce created through freight and logistics are somewhat \u2018invisible\u2019, e-commerce businesses have a significant visible footprint which is through the packaging utilised when importing and exporting goods. One year of packaging on a global scale is estimated to equal one billion trees, or 5000 packages per second. As such, e-commerce businesses holistically cause significant environmental harm, yet there is vast potential for e-commerce businesses to pave the way towards a more sustainable online retail economy through reducing their scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.\u00a0\nE-commerce businesses have little physical presence, therefore the bulk of their carbon footprint are scope 3 emissions. These emissions are indirect, and are associated with the emissions of external business processes - such as the practices of suppliers. However, these indirect emissions are widely unaccounted for, with findings stating that only 25% of reporting companies engage with suppliers to try to reduce their carbon emissions. Failure to actively engage with these critical emissions means that companies will forfeit the opportunity of overall emissions reduction, thus meaning they will not reap the benefits of decarbonisation.\nEffective decarbonisation strategies for reducing the carbon footprint of e-commerce businesses\n1. Using sustainable packaging\u00a0\nReducing packaging or transitioning to reusable and recyclable packaging concepts is a fundamental step which e-commerce businesses must embrace within their decarbonisation journey. Through transitioning away from unsustainable packaging, such as single-use plastics, to commonly less expensive and more sustainable multi-use packaging; e-commerce businesses will recognise immense cost savings and waste reduction.\u00a0\n2. Monitoring scope 3 emissions\nIn order for e-commerce businesses to truly reduce their emissions, it is vital that a key focus is placed upon reducing scope 3 emissions. Scope 3 emissions can account for up to 80% of a company\u2019s emissions, thus mapping out these indirect emissions created by other businesses and functions within the supply chain is vital if businesses wish to reap the benefits of true decarbonisation. Plan A offers a comprehensive software that allows e-commerce businesses to monitor and reduce their scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions effectively.\u00a0\nScope 3 emissions are those indirectly produced by other businesses and functions in a company\u2019s supply chain, and since these emissions are often the province of other organisations, they are notoriously hard to monitor.\n3. Reducing scope 3 emissions and increasing supply chain efficiency\u00a0\nE-commerce businesses must map out and analyse their supply chain to understand where the bulk of their emissions are coming from. In doing so, the origins of goods and their transportation methods can further be evaluated. For example, an e-commerce business could reduce their CO2 footprint by up to 25 times through choosing to purchase products in bulk and storing them in a warehouse in the EU rather than regularly ordering the products via international air-freight. Furthermore, e-commerce businesses can leverage their vast influence through encouraging their suppliers to implement sustainable practices.\u00a0\nE-commerce businesses could cut out 30% of their overall supply chain emissions via operational changes, such as procuring a low-carbon energy alternative. As such, prioritising efficiency within every operational process - like ensuring maximum freight loads - is paramount to the effective implementation of a sustainability strategy.\u00a0\n4. Digitalisation and delivery services optimisation\u00a0\nIn today's fast-paced digital world, e-commerce businesses must prioritise sustainability and work to reduce their carbon footprint. Two key strategies that can help businesses decarbonise their operations are implementing carbon-neutral delivery services and leveraging technology to understand the environmental impact of their products.\nCarbon-neutral delivery services are an essential component of a sustainable e-commerce strategy. By partnering with delivery providers that offset their carbon emissions or utilise electric or alternative fuel vehicles, e-commerce businesses can significantly reduce their environmental impact. Companies should seek out delivery partners that share their commitment to sustainability and are transparent about their efforts to minimize their carbon footprint.\u00a0\nIn addition, e-commerce businesses should lean on technology to better understand the environmental footprint of their products. Advanced software solutions and tools can help businesses analyse and track the emissions associated with the production, transportation, and disposal of their products. By gaining insights into the life cycle of their products, companies can identify areas for improvement and make data-driven decisions to reduce their overall environmental impact.\u00a0\nEmbracing digital tools can also enable e-commerce businesses to engage with their suppliers and encourage the adoption of sustainable practices throughout their supply chain. By collaborating with suppliers, businesses can identify areas where emissions can be reduced, such as in the manufacturing process or transportation methods.\nAs ESG regulations continue to evolve and the demand for sustainable practices grows, e-commerce businesses must stay ahead of the curve and take proactive steps to decarbonise their operations. By adopting carbon-neutral delivery services and utilising technology to understand the environmental impact of their products, companies can effectively reduce their carbon footprint, meet regulatory requirements, and satisfy the growing consumer demand for sustainable practices. Ultimately, prioritising sustainability within every aspect of the supply chain is crucial for the long-term success of e-commerce businesses in an increasingly environmentally-conscious world.\nIn conclusion, the rapid expansion of e-commerce and online shopping has had a considerable impact on the environment, particularly through the production, packaging, and distribution of goods. As the sector continues to grow, e-commerce businesses must prioritise sustainability within their supply chains and adopt strategies to reduce their carbon footprint. Key steps include utilising sustainable packaging, monitoring and reducing scope 3 emissions, increasing supply chain efficiency, and adopting carbon-neutral delivery services.\nBy leveraging technology and embracing comprehensive solutions like Plan A's software, e-commerce businesses can effectively reduce their emissions and contribute to a more sustainable online retail landscape. As ESG regulations continue to evolve, the responsibility falls on e-commerce companies to act proactively and lead the way towards a greener future.\u00a0\n\u200d To explore how Plan A can assist in monitoring, reducing, and reporting on your e-commerce's carbon emissions, book a demo today .\nRead more\nBilan Carbone: Your complete guide\nCorporate Sustainability\nDecarbonisation strategy: The comprehensive guide for 2024\nCorporate Sustainability\nDecarbonisation strategy for SMEs: Top 10 low-hanging fruits for immediate impact\nCorporate Sustainability\nWhat does decarbonisation mean for companies?\nCorporate Sustainability\nHow banks can lead the way to global decarbonisation\nCorporate Sustainability\nHow will carbon pricing affect the global decarbonisation agenda?\nPolicy & Regulations\nGet your company on the path to net-zero\nBook a call with our sustainability experts\nGet in touch", "source": "https://plana.earth/academy/how-to-decarbonise-e-commerce-business", "metadata": {"title": "How to decarbonise your e-commerce business?", "content": ["E-commerce", "Decarbonisation ", "Supply chains", "Scope 3 emissions"]}}

C-suite leaders who allocate even limited resources towards sustainability through understanding how to effectively structure a sustainability budget will be able to realise the vast potential of sustainable transformation.\u00a0\nAs such, this resource should be closely considered by Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) , Chief Sustainability Officers (CSOs) , and also wider business stakeholders. In doing so, those who take lead on sustainability investment will realise why and how efforts towards green budgeting must be prioritised as businesses around the world undergo a sustainable transformation.\nWhat is a sustainability budget and why is it so important?\u00a0\nWhilst becoming sustainable requires an organisation-wide approach led by sustainability-oriented leaders, taking a proactive approach through the development and integration of a sustainability budget is a crucial step within the decarbonisation journey. Budgeting for sustainability involves allocating business resources towards activities that improve a company\u2019s capacity to maintain or endure the interplay of environmental, social, and economic factors. Investing in making your business more sustainable simultaneously improves the ESG performance of businesses, which is an increasingly important set of criteria used to assess a company\u2019s environmental, social, and governance impact.\u00a0\nAccordingly, focussing upon sustainability within budgeting through strategically allocating resources allows for businesses to develop a more resilient supply chain, ensure that they are compliant with relevant regulations, and meet the increasingly \u2018green\u2019 demands of stakeholders - with Oxford University finding that more than 80% of mainstream investors now consider \u2018ESG\u2019 and sustainability in their decision-making processes. Meanwhile, research shows that 57% of businesses plan on allocating more budget, time and people towards sustainability; businesses which undertake decarbonisation have been found to see 20% increases in revenue. In effect, CFOs and CEOs who work in conjunction with sustainability leaders - such as CSOs - to allocate a budget towards sustainability can not only defend business revenue, but also boost profits as businesses gain a competitive advantage.\nHow to convince leadership to allocate budget to sustainability\nTo convince business leadership to allocate resources towards a sustainability program, one can follow a number of steps to build the case for sustainability within an organisation.\u00a0\n- Show the business benefits: Sustainability initiatives can bring a variety of benefits to a business, with studies highlighting cost savings , increased efficiency, improved brand image, and access to new markets. Researching and presenting facts and case studies that demonstrate the positive impact of sustainability initiatives on other businesses in a given industry can help illustrate how peer companies are addressing the topic. For instance, a McKinsey report found that companies who incorporate sustainability within their budget could see a 60% improvement in operating profits through reducing resource costs.\u00a0\n- Demonstrate the risks of inaction: Explaining the risks and potential costs associated with not implementing a sustainability program, such as regulatory fines, reputation damage, and lost market share, help leadership understand that investing in sustainability is increasingly common practice in today's business landscape. For example, not acting on sustainability will lead to an increase in external costs - such as carbon taxes, with the carbon price increasing from \u20ac10.53 per metric ton in 2018 to more than \u20ac100 in March 2023.\n- Start small: Pitch a pilot programme or a small-scale initiative to show proof of concept and demonstrate the potential benefits. This can help build momentum and gain support for more significant sustainability initiatives in the future.\n- Engage stakeholders: Involving stakeholders from different departments, including finance, marketing, and operations, is an important step to gain buy-in and support. It is essential to have a cross-functional team to ensure that the sustainability program aligns with the business's strategic goals and objectives.\n- Set measurable goals: Establishing clear and measurable goals for the sustainability program, such as reducing waste, decreasing carbon emissions, or increasing the use of renewable energy is essential to build evidence on the program\u2019s impact, tracking progress and sharing results to build momentum and support for the program. \u200d\n- Be prepared to make a business case: Making a clear and compelling business case for the sustainability program should include a detailed budget, expected return on investment, and a timeline for implementation. Showing that the sustainability program can be profitable and provide long-term benefits to the business will increase the chances of gaining support from business leadership.\nIf there is a limited budget, where should resources be allocated?\u00a0\nPrioritising a limited budget to develop a sustainability team or strategy requires a strategic and systematic approach. Some steps that a company can follow to prioritise the right actions against a limited budget:\nIdentify your sustainability goals.\n\u200d This requires determining what sustainability objectives a company wants to achieve and how a sustainability team or strategy can help achieve those goals, which in turn helps define the scope and priorities of a sustainability program.\nEvaluate the cost-benefit of a sustainability team or strategy.\n\u200d Consider the potential impact of a sustainability team or strategy on business operations, customer satisfaction, and overall sustainability goals, and ask to determine what resources should be allocated to deliver on a respective outcome.\nStart small with a pilot program to gradually build momentum.\nIdentify what works and what doesn't, and how to most effectively spend resources, as well as secure buy-in from stakeholders. Further, setting metrics to measure the success of a sustainability programme and evaluate progress regularly helps to make adjustments to ensure goals are achieved efficiently that aligns with a company's business goals and objectives.\nLicence sustainability software.\n\u200d Software can support and educate the sustainability team along the journey of measuring, reducing and reporting the organisation's impacts. Software can help in laying out the journey ahead and educate on which data are needed, how to obtain it, and how to improve on this process. Meanwhile, having all impact data in a single place across departments helps with the continuous tracking, monitoring, and reporting, for example, the organisation\u2019s GHG emissions. Furthermore, early access to examples of decarbonisation and expert support can help the team to determine which exact resources are needed in the path ahead. Ultimately, as found within a total cost of ownership (TCO) analysis by Hurwitz , avoiding costly manual data collection, input and analysis through the utilisation of SaaS will eliminate vast capital cost, decrease risk and bolster the overall reliability of a business' sustainability budget.\nAs the world works to meet the Paris Agreement, sustainability budgeting will only increase in importance. This aforementioned guide can serve as a great blueprint to embarking on your sustainability journey and allocating a budget towards sustainability. Businesses that are proactive and invest from the get-go in comprehensive decarbonisation technologies, such as Plan A\u2019s sustainability platform , will ultimately realise immense improvements in their return-on-income (ROI) via saving on time and carbon.\nLearn how to efficiently implement sustainability within your business and book a demo with Plan A.\nRead more\nBilan Carbone: Your complete guide\nCorporate Sustainability\nDecarbonisation strategy: The comprehensive guide for 2024\nCorporate Sustainability\nDecarbonisation strategy for SMEs: Top 10 low-hanging fruits for immediate impact\nCorporate Sustainability\nHow CFO's can unlock sustainability success\nCorporate Sustainability\nThe evolving responsibilities of Chief Sustainability Officers\nCorporate Sustainability\nWhat does decarbonisation mean for companies?\nCorporate Sustainability\nGet your company on the path to net-zero\nBook a call with our sustainability experts\nGet in touch", "source": "https://plana.earth/academy/prepare-sustainability-budget-2023", "metadata": {"title": "How to prepare a sustainability budget in 2023", "content": ["Sustainability", "Budget", "Chief Sustainability Officer", "Chief Financial Officer"]}}

Effectively managing your stakeholders is critical.\nCorporate Sustainability\nStakeholders\nnet zero emissions\nMay 31, 2023\nWill Basil-Jones\nThe global economy is undergoing a rapid transition towards a low-carbon state, whereby global businesses are realising that transitioning towards net-zero carbon emissions, via a process of decarbonisation , is crucial to the long-term viability of their operations. Businesses who wish to remain competitive will therefore need to calculate their scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions , set science-based targets, develop decarbonisation pathways, and gradually move towards long-term carbon capture, storage, and sequestration for those emissions which cannot be reduced.\u00a0\nHowever, businesses cannot undergo green transition on their own - there are a range of stakeholders that must be actively engaged with on this journey. As such, it is absolutely vital that businesses which commit to reducing their carbon emissions gain a comprehensive understanding of the best stakeholder engagement and management practices to ensure an efficient and effective transition.\nWho are stakeholders within the net-zero transition?\nBeyond the influence of government bodies and policy drivers; there are a number of groups that directly or indirectly affect, or are affected by, business activities. Accordingly, these groups affected by businesses are called stakeholders, and they play a key role in placing pressure on businesses to act on climate change and reduce their emissions. These stakeholders play a critical role in the success of any business, and therefore must be a key consideration within all aspects of business decision-making. The different stakeholder groups include:\n- Employees\n- Consumers\n- B2B customers (suppliers)\n- Investors/Shareholders\u00a0\n- Non-government organisations (NGOs)\nRead more about the stakeholders of climate change here.\nWhy is stakeholder engagement crucial within the net-zero journey?\nEffective stakeholder management is absolutely crucial within the journey towards net-zero. Businesses who identify their stakeholders and balance their needs will be able to create long-term value, whilst engaging with stakeholders also creates opportunities to learn more about their needs, concerns, and expectations regarding the business and its operations. Ultimately, clear and transparent dialogue with stakeholders regarding the business\u2019 sustainability strategy will promote mutual understanding and trust whilst mitigating both the financial and non-financial risks of sustainability.\u00a0\nGiven the foundational role that stakeholders play within the overall operation of businesses, a central focus of stakeholder management should be on demonstrating credibility and translating value to stakeholders.\u00a0\n- Effectively managing employees within the net-zero journey is fundamental as human resources are vital to completing decarbonisation and sustainability related activities. The benefits of engaging employees with the business\u2019 sustainability strategy are demonstrated through findings of an increase in employee satisfaction, productivity, retention and engagement.\u00a0\n- Meanwhile, consumers are crucial to the long-term success of any business. Therefore, ensuring consumers are aware of the business\u2019 sustainability stance is key within the decarbonisation process. In doing so, businesses can improve their brand value and sales; with a Nielsen study highlighting that sustainable product sales have grown by nearly 20% \u2014 four times more than conventional product growth.\u00a0\n- Engaging B2B customers across the businesses supply chain with the business\u2019 sustainability strategy is key to achieving set targets and reducing scope 3 emissions. Carbon is money; and with new EU regulations such as the CSRD coming into play - not acting on carbon emissions will increase costs in the long run due to increased regulations and carbon taxes.\u00a0\nFinally, investors typically play a key role in the growth and development of businesses. Meanwhile, an Oxford university study found that more than 80% of mainstream investors now consider \u2018ESG\u2019 \u2013 environmental, social and governance \u2013 information when making investment decisions. As such, businesses must ensure that the needs of investors are balanced. In ensuring that there is clear and open communication surrounding the role of sustainability within their overall strategy, businesses will create value via enhanced investment returns and allow for long-term investment and asset optimisation .\nThe net-zero journey, explained.\nCredit:\u00a0Plan A\n6 stakeholder management strategies vital to the the low-carbon transition\nUndertaking engagement activities are clearly a vital formative step when tackling decarbonisation initiatives. As such, a key first step to stakeholder management is the development of a strong communications strategy. A strong communications strategy will engage stakeholders, confidently communicate decarbonisation initiatives, and translate the value of businesses' wider net zero action plan. Specifically, the steps that decarbonising businesses should prioritise and engage stakeholders with include:\n- Setting and validating net-zero targets will be expected by stakeholders, and it is advised that businesses\u2019 set science based targets (SBT\u2019s) to put their emissions reductions commitments on the right trajectory. SBT\u2019s align emissions reductions with the latest climate science for limiting warming to 1.5\u00ba C or well below 2\u00ba C, and are considered the gold standard in emissions reductions targets, particularly among the investor community. Setting and validating SBT\u2019s will also help businesses improve their disclosure performance against the major reporting frameworks and gives you full confidence in your carbon footprint.\n- Risk and opportunity analysis is vital within the management of stakeholders (particularly investors). Stakeholders want to see that against these scenarios, businesses have fully analysed both the risks and the opportunities that sustainability poses to the business and its value chain. Businesses should develop ongoing capabilities for their holistic and dynamic assessments of transition-related risks to be communicated, allowing for opportunities relating to shifts in regulations, investor preferences, consumer behaviours, and competition to be evaluated by the business and its stakeholders.\n- Footprint calculation and validation via the utilisation of a carbon accounting software, such as Plan A , is key to demonstrating credibility to external stakeholders. Businesses\u2019 that validate their carbon footprint can also improve their disclosure performance against the major reporting frameworks. Meanwhile, carbon footprint calculation and validation completed by independent experts guarantees accuracy.\n- Incorporate climate-related considerations into critical decision-making processes across various domains, such as strategy, risk, finance, R&D, operations (including supplier management and procurement ), organisational structure, talent management, pricing, marketing, and relationships with investors and government entities. Furthermore, consider the possibility of adopting\u00a0 sustainability leadership within the company's organisational structure who oversees the broader business ecosystem - encompassing investors, supply chains, customers, and regulatory bodies.\n- Repositioning to meet the increasingly sustainable demands of consumers is a key step within the net-zero transition. Not to be confused with greenwashing , companies should truthfully communicate the role of sustainability within their operations and their net-zero progress with consumers to build trust and brand value. This may involve investing in new physical assets and reallocating capital, redesigning products, or utilising their communications channels to highlight their sustainable actions to consumers.\n- Ensuring employees are involved and educated on the company\u2019s net-zero journey is key to building an effective sustainability strategy. Educating employees on the importance of the global net-zero transition and up skilling employees to ensure the net-zero goals of the company are met is key. Senior-level leaders should take ownership of the sustainability agenda to ensure alignment organisation-wide.\u00a0\nAn overview of 6 key strategies to manage stakeholders in the net-zero transition.\nCredit: Plan A\n\u200d Plan A\u2019s data-driven decarbonisation platform can streamline key processes such as science based target setting, carbon footprint calculation and validation, thus ensuring businesses can leverage the vast opportunities relating to the net-zero transition. However, the clock is ticking. Businesses who do not manage their stakeholders as they undergo decarbonisation will ultimately forfeit their ability to mitigate risk and sustain a competitive advantage.\nFor tailored support on efficiently and effectively balancing the managing stakeholders within the sustainability journey, book a demo with Plan A today .\nRead more\nBilan Carbone: Your complete guide\nCorporate Sustainability\nDecarbonisation strategy: The comprehensive guide for 2024\nCorporate Sustainability\nDecarbonisation strategy for SMEs: Top 10 low-hanging fruits for immediate impact\nCorporate Sustainability\nThe stakeholders of climate change\nClimate Science\nPlan A and Kite Insights partner to accelerate corporate decarbonisation\nPlan A News\nSustainability in fashion: A guide to ESG regulations\nPolicy & Regulations\nGet your company on the path to net-zero\nBook a call with our sustainability experts\nGet in touch", "source": "https://plana.earth/academy/manage-stakeholders-net-zero-transition", "metadata": {"title": "How to manage your stakeholders in the net-zero transition", "content": ["Stakeholders", "net zero emissions"]}}

For most industries, 92% of a company's emissions come from scope 3 (indirect emissions) - meaning that only 8% of GHG emissions account for scopes 1 and 2 of emissions . The equation is explicit: for companies to reduce their emissions, they must set their efforts on scope 3 emissions and their entire supply chain. But since organisations do not control suppliers directly, how can companies measure their supplier's emissions to then be able to reduce them?\u00a0\nThis article explains how to measure and reduce your suppliers' carbon footprint - including one of the best carbon accounting solutions available on the market.\u00a0\nThe carbon footprint of supply chains\nSupply chains are responsible for 92% of a company's carbon footprint\nCredit: William N\nOn average, supply chain emissions are 11.4 times higher than operational emissions , equating to approximately 92% of an organisation's total GHG emissions . In other words, the value chain and suppliers are a tremendous opportunity for companies to reduce their carbon footprint drastically.\u00a0\nThus, suppliers are increasingly pressured to act for sustainability. According to McKinsey , Consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies are also expected to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 92% by 2050. Also, CDP's Supply Chain: Changing the Chain environmental report shows that suppliers could reduce emissions by a gigaton (one billion metric tonnes) by increasing their renewable purchases by 20% .\u00a0\nClimate risk is a financial risk for companies and suppliers. Consequently, suppliers expect environmental risks to have an economic impact of US$1.26 trillion in the next five years. It is also estimated that corporate buyers will face a cost hike of US$120 billion due to ecological risks raised by suppliers. This can be translated into higher costs, lower profitability and greater risk exposure if no climate action is taken.\u00a0\nFurthermore, new business practices now require companies to set emissions reduction targets throughout their value chain ( scope 3 ). This process is only achievable with solid supply chain engagement . Nevertheless, businesses that do not engage suppliers in climate action will lose competitiveness and resilience, resulting in lower costs, better reputations and, ultimately, the ability to survive in an uncertain and unpredictable environment.\nHow to measure your suppliers' emissions?\nThere is a carbon accounting solution to calculate your suppliers' emissions . As part of its carbon management and ESG platform, Plan A just added an innovative suppliers module - adding to the family of scope three calculators.\u00a0\nThe best carbon accounting software for suppliers emissions\nCredit: Plan A\nWhat does it do? Plan A's new Suppliers Module allows businesses to track, report and reduce emissions beyond scopes 1 and 2 by providing a complete overview of Scope 3 supplier emissions. In addition, our platform's customisable reports allow for streamlined compliance with NFRD, SFRD and other ESG reporting requirements.\nWhy is it useful? The new supplier's module is the latest addition to the scope three emissions family calculator. Calculating your supply chain's emissions is the first step to reducing them. The supplier's calculator is the perfect tool to start your decarbonisation journey, giving accurate insights into your suppliers' carbon footprint.\u00a0\nHow does it work? Collecting data from external sources, collating them and providing an overview of suppliers' emissions is a huge challenge. The Plan A Supplier Module solves this blocker by providing multiple ways to calculate the carbon footprint of your purchased goods and services.\u00a0\nDepending on the initial availability of data, companies can get started with spend-based data (invoices etc.) and work their way to data excellence by replacing it with activity and usage data.\u00a0\nStart your company's decarbonisation journey with Plan A's supplier's module. Measure and reduce your supply chain's emissions seamlessly.\u00a0\nHow to reduce your supplier's emissions?\u00a0\nOnce companies measure their supply chain emissions, they can set a reduction and decarbonisation plan. It is essential to identify suppliers as allies in GHG emissions reduction efforts. The supply chain emissions of a company often exceed its operational emissions . Therefore, the totality of each company's GHG emissions needs to be considered.\u00a0\nHere are a couple of recommendations to reduce your suppliers' emissions:\u00a0\n- Setting supply chain emissions reduction goals.\n- Providing technical support to suppliers\n- Sharing best practices\n- Adopting supplier codes of conduct\n- Incorporating sustainability standards in procurement of goods and services from suppliers.\nCompanies can explore energy efficiency, develop innovative packaging and transportation techniques, manage natural resource consumption, and encourage suppliers to purchase green power as renewable energy becomes more ubiquitous as they gain experience in reducing GHG emissions within their operations.\u00a0\n\u2022 Assess the economic and social value of supply chain engagement . Suppliers and participating companies benefit from monetary savings, decreased risk exposure, and better alignment between sustainable practices and customer preferences. Thus, strong communications are needed to share emissions risks and opportunities to investors and consumers, who increasingly demand companies report on their GHG emissions.\u00a0\n\u2022 Develop internal engagement support systems.\nBuild support from executive leadership and diverse teams across departments (e.g. procurement, green groups, operations) to ensure sustainability strategies are incorporated into business decision-making processes. Develop innovative practices across all levels of the organisation and encourage sustainable behaviour.\u00a0\n\u2022 Establish environmental goals in collaboration with suppliers. Establish a strategy for identifying and leveraging high-impact suppliers and replicating successful models throughout the supply chain. Companies shall include third-party technical assistance programs. Celebrate suppliers who have accomplished their goals and maintain open communication for best practices.\nBy developing relationships with suppliers that are collaborative and environmentally friendly, corporations will be able to adapt better to the uncertainty and change that can occur in the economy, physical environment, and regulatory environment.\nSign up for a free demo today if you are ready to measure and reduce your supplier's carbon footprint and lower your company's overall emissions.\nRead more\nBilan Carbone: Your complete guide\nCorporate Sustainability\nDecarbonisation strategy: The comprehensive guide for 2024\nCorporate Sustainability\nDecarbonisation strategy for SMEs: Top 10 low-hanging fruits for immediate impact\nCorporate Sustainability\nNo items found.\nGet your company on the path to net-zero\nBook a call with our sustainability experts\nGet in touch", "source": "https://plana.earth/academy/suppliers-carbon-footprint-measure-reduce-scope-3-emissions", "metadata": {"title": "Supplier's carbon footprint: measure and reduce scope 3 emissions", "content": ["Supply chains", "Scope 3 emissions"]}}

Will you follow their lead?\nPolicy & Regulations\nTCFD\nPolicy\nUnited Kingdom\nESG\nClimate disclosure\nSeptember 1, 2022\nTara Bernoville\nThe Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) develops consistent climate-related financial risk disclosures for companies, banks, and investors to inform stakeholders.\nThe TCFD started as voluntary recommendations but soon became critical for the climate disclosure regulatory framework. Many jurisdictions follow the TCFD recommendations, including the European Union, Singapore, Canada, Japan and South Africa. Following these countries, the United Kingdom and New Zealand are mandating climate-risk disclosure in line with the TCFD, starting in 2025 and 2023, respectively. As part of efforts to comprehensively address global climate change, these regulations are essential steps in the right direction. Thus, it is only a matter of time before businesses are mandated to act on the TCFD's recommendations .\nTo support corporations and financial institutions in complying with the TCFD, Plan A's policy experts have developed a comprehensive factsheet on the TCFD, including what the TCFD is about and how companies shall comply in line with its recommendations.\nWhat is the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)?\nThe Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) was created in 2015 by the international Financial Stability Board (FSB) to develop consistent climate-related financial risk disclosures for use by companies, banks, and investors. The aim is to provide financial stability globally, as climate change will negatively impact our economy.\nThe main objective of TCFD reporting is to disclose the climate-related risks and opportunities of a company as well as the financial impact those might have on the company's operations and business model.\nIncreasing transparency makes markets more efficient and economies more stable and resilient.\n- Michael R. Bloomberg\nThe TCFD reporting frameworks provide consistent and transparent information to all financial actors and global markets. Firms' climate-related disclosures are made more consistent and comparable under this initiative. Also, the TCFD believes that better information will allow companies to incorporate climate-related risks and opportunities into their risk management, strategic planning and decision-making processes. It also enables better ESG management and induced performance. \u00a0\nThe TCFD is not a corporate reporting standard but a way of understanding how firms approach the financial risks and opportunities related to climate change.\nWhich companies are subject to TCFD-aligned reporting?\nThe TCFD support in numbers\nCredit: Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures - 2021 Status Report\nThe TCFD is still mainly a voluntary framework for companies of all sizes, industries and jurisdictions. However, more countries are considering making TCFD-aligned climate-risk reporting mandatory . Companies need to start aligning with the TCFD to stay ahead of the competition, develop a future-proof roadmap for their operations to comply with current and future climate policies and access advanced financial resources such as corporate green bonds.\n\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 Mandatory TCFD-aligned reporting in the UK\n\u200d From 6 April 2022, over 1,300 of the largest UK-registered companies and financial institutions must disclose climate-related financial information on a mandatory basis.\nAs of April 2022, UK companies with the following criteria are obliged to TCFD-aligned reporting: \u200d\n1. All UK companies that are currently required to produce a non-financial information statement:\n- UK companies that have more than 500 employees and\n- Transferable securities admitted to trading on the UK regulated market, banking companies or insurance companies (Relevant Public Interest Entities (PIEs)\n2. UK registered companies with securities admitted to AIM with more than 500 employees.\n3. The UK registered companies which are not included in the categories above have more than 500 employees and a turnover of more than \u00a3500m\n4. LLPs which have more than 500 employees and a turnover of more than \u00a3500m\nWhat do companies disclose in their TCFD-aligned report?\nA TCFD-aligned report should contain all relevant information on a company's climate-related risks and opportunities as well as the resulting financial impacts of those. \u200d\nCore reporting elements and recommendations in line with TCFD \u200d\nTCFD Recommendations & Supporting Recommended Disclosures\nSource: Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 2021 Status Report\nThe TCFD requires companies and LLPs to disclose climate-related financial information in line with the four overarching pillars of the regulation's recommendations on a mandatory basis (Governance, Strategy, Risk Management, Metrics & Targets). Now, let's explain how these recommendations are defined:\n- Governance: The organisation's governance around climate-related risks and opportunities;\n- Strategy : The actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organisation's businesses, strategy, and financial planning;\n- Risk Management: The processes used by the organisation to identify, assess, and manage climate-related risks;\n- Metrics and Targets: The metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant climate-related risks and opportunities.\nThese necessary disclosures help investors and others understand how reporting organisations consider and assess climate-related risks and opportunities and their economic impacts.\nFind more information on the TCFD Guidance on Metrics, Targets and Transition Plans , and TCFD Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures .\nPrinciples for reporting\nThe TCFD defined seven principles for adequate disclosures:\n- Represent relevant information;\n- Be specific and complete;\n- Clear, balanced and understandable;\n- Consistent over time;\n- Comparable among others within a sector, industry or portfolio;\n- Reliable, verifiable and objective;\n- Provided on a timely basis.\nHow must companies disclose their TCFD-aligned report?\n- The TCFD-aligned reports will be published together with a company's mainstream financial filings.\n- TCFD-aligned reports shall be issued within four months of a company's financial year-end.\n- Companies must report climate-related financial information in the non-financial statement, which forms part of the Strategic Report.\n- LLPs will be required to report climate-related financial information in either the non-financial notice that forms part of their Strategic Report or the Energy and Carbon Report that forms part of their Annual Report.\nThe application date of the TCFD\nRegulations are to be made by the end of 2021, with rules coming into force on the Common Commencement Date of 6 April 2022 and applicable for accounting periods starting or after that date.\nThus, most companies with a calendar financial year will need to include the mandatory climate-related financial disclosures for the first time in their annual report and account for the financial year commencing on 1 January and ending on 31 December 2023.\nTCFD Guidance\nNon-binding Q&A will be produced to support companies in applying these requirements. \u200d\nStart reporting on your environmental impact today.

The aim is to reduce emissions by 65% of 1990 levels by 2030.\nDownload Policy Factsheet\nBack to Policy Centre\nWhat is Germany\u2019s Climate Protection Act ( Bundes-Klimaschutzgesetz )?\n- On June 24th , the German Parliament will decide on the proposed reform of Germany's Climate Protection Act.\n- The German government presented a new draft of the currently existing Climate Protection Act (entered into force on December 12 2019) after the Federal Constitutional Court held that it is partly unconstitutional in March 2021. The court is calling for stricter climate measures to protect civil liberties for the period after 2030 and the Climate Protection Act has to be amended by the end of 2022.\n- If the German Parliament establishes the law, the German Council can still object and convene a mediation committee. It is not known yet when it will be on the agenda of the Council. There will still be media coverage of the Parliament's decision.\nClimate Protection Act - What's new?\n- To implement the Constitutional Court's order, the Climate Protection Act reform establishes new national climate protection goals.\n- A new interim target of 65% (instead of the previous 55%) greenhouse gas reduction compared to 1990 is set for 2030.\u00a0\n- By 2040, the reduction should be 88%. By 2045, greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced to achieve greenhouse gas neutrality.\u00a0\n- After 2050 negative greenhouse gas emissions must be achieved.\n- For the years 2030, 2040 and 2045, it is also determined which contributions are to be achieved in the land use, land use change and forestry sectors.\n- In 2032, the federal government will present a legislative proposal to legally establish different annual reduction targets up to net greenhouse gas neutrality in 2045.\n- The reduction targets for the individual sectors (energy, industry, buildings, transport, agriculture and waste management) are being redefined to comply with these requirements.\n- The energy industry is facing the strictest restrictions - it has to reduce its annual emissions from 280 million tonnes of CO 2 equivalent in 2020 to 108 million tonnes in 2030.\n- Annual reduction targets are set across all sectors for 2031 to 2040. How these will be divided between the sectors will be decided in 2024.\nCriticisms\n- \"It is not defined how/with what instruments the goals are planned to be reached.\"\n- \"The draft does not define sufficient goals and does not set a CO2 budget.\"\n- \"It is rushed, not thought through, and only a campaign manoeuvre.\"\n- \"It does not consider how to deal with the competitive disadvantages companies and industries will face due to the changes.\"\n\u200d The clock is ticking!

Ensure the integrity of the EU financial system and monitor its orderly transition to sustainability;\nf. Develop international sustainable finance initiatives and standards, and support the EU partner countries.\nNote: The Commission will report on the Strategy's implementation by the end of 2023.\n2. European Green Bond Standard\n- The EU Commission proposed a Regulation on a European Green Bond Standard (EUGBS).\n- The EUGBS intends to be a voluntary \"gold standard\" for green bonds.\n- Issuers of green bonds will have a robust tool to show they are funding green projects aligned with the EU Taxonomy.\n- Investors buying the bonds will be able to see that their investments are more easily sustainable, thereby reducing the risk of greenwashing.\n- The standard will use the detailed definitions of green economic activities in the EU Taxonomy to define what is considered a green investment.\n- This standard will address concerns about greenwashing and protecting market integrity to ensure that legitimate environmental projects are financed.\n3. The amendment to the EU Taxonomy\n- The European Commission also adopted a Delegated Act supplementing Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation\n- The Taxonomy Regulation requires financial and certain non-financial institutions to provide information to investors about the environmental performance of their assets and economic activities.\n- The Delegated Act specifies the content, methodology and presentation of information to be disclosed by large financial and non-financial companies on the share of their business, investments or lending activities aligned with the EU Taxonomy:\na. Non-financial companies will have to disclose the share of their turnover, capital, and operational expenditure associated with environmentally sustainable economic activities and any future delegated acts on other environmental objectives\nb. Financial institutions, mainly large banks, asset managers, investment firms and insurance/reinsurance companies, will have to disclose the share of environmentally sustainable economic activities in the total assets they finance or invest in.\n- The Delegated Act will be transmitted for scrutiny by the European Parliament and the Council for four months, extendable once by two months. Therefore it will most likely be set into force by the end of 2021.\n\u200d The clock is ticking! Start reporting on climate risk and sustainability by complying with the EU Finance Regulations.

It is a tool to help companies and investors make sustainable investment decisions. EU Taxonomy disclosures must be made as part of the NFRD/CSRD and SFDR reporting requirements.\nDownload Policy Factsheet\nBack to Policy Centre\nWhat is the EU Taxonomy?\n- The EU Taxonomy is a classification that sets criteria to determine whether an economic activity significantly contributes to the six environmental objectives as defined in the regulation:\n\u25e6 Climate change mitigation;\n\u25e6 Climate change adaptation;\n\u25e6 Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources;\n\u25e6 Transition to a circular economy, including waste prevention and recycling;\u00a0\n\u25e6 Pollution prevention and control;\u00a0\n\u25e6 Protection of healthy ecosystems.\u00a0\n- The EU Taxonomy is a tool to help companies and investors make sustainable investment decisions.\n- The Taxonomy is part of the EU Sustainable Finance Package that helps to improve the flow of money towards sustainable activities across the European Union.\nWhich companies are subject to the EU Taxonomy?\nThe EU Taxonomy uses the scopes of the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) and the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD)* to define its own scope. However, it requires additional disclosures from financial market participants and large companies to those laid out in the SFDR and NFRD.\nWhat needs to be disclosed?\nDue to the complexity of the EU Taxonomy and because part of the methodology still needs to be defined, the disclosure requirements for the companies are being phased in over the course of the next four years. The final goal of the requirements is that:\n- Companies under the scope of the NFRD have to report the share of their \u201cenvironmentally sustainable\u201d economic activities (as defined by the EU Taxonomy) in their Revenue, their Capex, and their OPEX.\u00a0\n- Financial market participants will have to disclose how their financial products in the scope of the SFDR are aligning with the EU Taxonomy.\u00a0\nWhere to report?\n- Companies in scope of the NFRD have to report their Taxonomy disclosure as part of the annual NFRD report, which needs to be published together with a companies\u2019 management report.\n- The Taxonomy disclosure of companies in scope of the SFDR needs to be published in periodic reviews and pre-contractual disclosures.\nCurrent state of Taxonomy implementation\n- In addition to the NFRD reporting requirements, as of January 2022 companies in scope have to disclose the percentage of their economic activities eligible for the EU Taxonomy (for the year 2022).**\u00a0\n- In addition to the SFDR requirements, as of January 2022 financial institutions have to disclose the proportion of their total assets of exposures to Taxonomy non-eligible and Taxonomy-eligible economic activities.\nTimeline of disclosure requirements\nThe timeline of disclosure requirements for the EU Taxonomy\nCredit: Plan A\nWill the disclosure requirements be externally assured?\n- The non-financial statements of companies in scope of the NFRD are subject to an existence check by the statutory auditor. There is no requirement in Union Law to verify the content of the disclosures. As soon as the CSRD* is in place, the content of the statements will be audited.\n- The compliance of the disclosures of financial institutions that are subject to the SFDR will be monitored by competent authorities.\n* The Non-Financial Reporting Directive will be amended by the already proposed Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) - most likely from 2024. With the CSRD more companies will be subject to the reporting requirements, the reporting requirements will be defined by the EU and the disclosures will be subject to external assurance.

Reporting is completed on an annual basis.\nDownload Policy Factsheet\nBack to Policy Centre\nWhat is the CDP Climate Disclosure Framework?\nThe CDP reporting framework for SMEs is open to anyone and can be used directly by SMEs to guide their reporting of climate impacts and strategies to multiple stakeholders.\u00a0\nFor the framework, SMEs are defined as non-subsidiary organisations with fewer than 500 employees . It is sub-categorised in:\u00a0\n\u25cb Micro-enterprises (fewer than 10 employees)\u00a0\n\u25cb Small enterprises (10-50 employees)\u00a0\n\u25cb Medium enterprises (50-500 employees)\u00a0\nThe structure of the framework\n- The framework is designed modularly to enable flexibility to expand into different areas of environmental disclosure.\u00a0\n- It consists of three core modules:\n\u25cb Measure\n\u25cb Commit\n\u25cb Action & Impact\n- Also, it consists of four additional modules:\n\u25cb Energy Reporting\n\u25cb Value Chain Emissions\n\u25cb Management & Resilience\n\u25cb Climate Solutions\n- Each module recommends (\u201cshould\u201d) or requires (\u201cshall\u201d) specific indicators and metrics from SMEs that are considered to be necessary, factoring in the requirements of data users and the needs of the SMEs.\u00a0\n- CDP recommends that SMEs adopt the core modules immediately and suggest they report on the additional modules within three years .\u00a0\nHow to use the CDP framework?\u00a0\n- This framework lays out the critical climate-related indicators SMEs should report on and use to inform their disclosures. Companies may report this information in their mainstream reports or when using other data collection or reporting platforms.\u00a0\n- The framework does not contain detailed guidance on reporting on the indicators. However, the SME Climate Hub has a dedicated \u201ctools and resources\u201d section that CDP encourages SMEs to utilise when reporting on the indicators in this framework.\u00a0\n- The disclosures shall be:\u00a0\n\u25cb Relevant to SMEs and their data users\n\u25cb Clear and understandable \t\n\u25cb Objective and accurate\u00a0\n\u25cb Complete and verifiable\u00a0\n\u25cb Comparable to best practice corporate disclosures\u00a0\n\u25cb Drive impactful SME climate action\u00a0\n\u25cb Annual and provided in a consistent format\nWhy should SMEs report?\u00a0\n- Globally, micro-enterprises (SMEs with fewer than ten employees) account for 70% to 90% of all firms. As such, SMEs play an essential role in reducing global emissions.\u00a0\n- As high emitting sectors and big enterprises have been transitioning to climate action and neutrality, SMEs might face a competitive disadvantage if they do not start.\n- SMEs are increasingly requested to commit to reducing their emissions and report progress on their commitments to their stakeholders and lenders.\u00a0\n- Because supply chain emissions are, on average, 11.4 times higher than operational emissions, large companies ask their suppliers (often SMEs) to measure, report and cut down their emissions. SMEs that can not demonstrate their environmental action and risk may lose out on significant opportunities.\nKeep up with climate risk disclosure by reporting on the CDP framework.

The law also sets the intermediate target of reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990.\nDownload Policy Factsheet\nBack to Policy Centre\nWhat is the European Climate Law?\n- On June 24 2021, the European Parliament formally approved the new European Climate Law\n- The EU Commission proposed the first draft of the new law in March 2020\n- The European Parliament and the European Council reached an agreement on the proposal in April 2021\n- As soon as the European Council also formally approves, the European Climate Law will enter into force\n- As one of the critical elements of the European Green Deal, the European Climate Law enshrines the EU's commitment to reaching climate neutrality by 2050.\nWhat is included?\n- An EU-wide legal target for climate neutrality by 2050 that binds the EU Institutions and national governments.\n- A 2030 climate target of at least 55% reduction of net emissions as compared to 1990, with clarity on the contribution of emission reductions and removals.\n- Recognition of the need to enhance the EU's carbon sink through more ambitious regulation.\n- A process for setting a 2040 climate target, taking into account an indicative greenhouse gas budget for 2030-2050.\n- A commitment to negative emissions after 2050.\n- The establishment of a European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change that will provide independent scientific advice.\n- A commitment to engage with sectors to prepare sector-specific roadmaps charting the path to climate neutrality in different areas of the economy.\nWhat's next?\nFurther legislative action will follow. The European Commission has already announced it will table a legislative \"Fit for 55 package\" to achieve the new emission reduction goal for 2030.\n\u200d The clock is ticking!

The European Commission proposed the package in July 2021. Development of the legislation package is still underway, and implementation is expected for 2024-2025.\nDownload Policy Factsheet\nBack to Policy Centre\nWhat is \u201cFit for 55\u201d?\n- At the end of June 2021, the European Union decided on the new European Climate Law that targets a 55% decrease in Greenhouse Gas emissions by 2030.\n- With \u201cFit for 55\u201d, the European Commission presented its plan to achieve those reduction goals on 14 July 2021.\n- The legislation package strengthens eight existing pieces of legislation. It presents five new initiatives across a range of policy areas and economic sectors: climate, energy and fuels, transport, buildings, land use and forestry.\n- The new climate target and the Fit for 55 packages are critical components of the European Union\u2019s green growth strategy \u2013 the European Green Deal.\nWhat is most relevant for companies?\nExpansion of Emission Trade System\n- A vital element of the package is to build on the important achievements of the EU Emission Trading System (ETS) by strengthening and applying it to new sectors.\n- The ETS is a key EU instrument for reducing greenhouse gas emissions for the industrial and energy sectors. It currently covers around 40% of emissions in the EU.\n- To strengthen the role of carbon pricing in the transport sector, the Commission proposes to gradually extend the current EU ETS to the maritime sector between 2023 and 2025.\n- Greater efforts will also be required from aviation operators to reduce their emissions, which is why the Commission proposes to phase out the free emissions allowances this sector currently receives.\n- Furthermore, the Commission proposes a separate emissions trade system for road transport and buildings from 2026. That is because fossil fuels used by road transport and buildings are substantial sources of emissions and pollution.\n- All these measures will include introducing taxes on shipping and aviation fuels, a de-facto phasing out gasoline and diesel cars by 2035, and new levies on building heating and insulation emissions.\nCarbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)\n- If international partners do not share a similar ambition to the EU, there is a risk of carbon leakage whereby production is transferred from the EU to other countries with lower ambitions for emission reduction.\n- To prevent that, the European Commission proposes a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism that puts a price on imports of a limited number of high-polluting goods based on their carbon content.\n- Under CBAM, companies will have to buy carbon credits that mirror the prices paid by the European industry.\nSocial Climate Fund\n- The Commission proposes a new Social Climate Fund that shall promote fairness and solidarity between and within the Member States while mitigating the risk of energy and mobility poverty.\n- The Social Climate Fund will provide\u00a0\u20ac72.2 billion\u00a0in current prices between 2025 and 2032 in the EU budget from the new Emissions Trading System.\n- It will enable the Member States to support vulnerable low and middle-income households, transport users, and micro-enterprises affected by the impact of the extension of emission trading to building and transports.\nWhat to expect next?\n- None of the proposed measurements are set in stone yet. They face about two years of negotiations between the European Parliament and Commission member governments.\n- Most measurements will only apply (if agreed upon within the EU) from 2025 to 2026.\nThe clock is ticking!

While TCFD-aligned reporting initially started as a voluntary reporting framework, more and more jurisdictions are making it a mandatory requirement for certain companies.\nDownload Policy Factsheet\nBack to Policy Centre\nWhat is the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)?\n- The\u00a0Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures\u00a0(TCFD) was created by the international\u00a0Financial Stability Board\u00a0(FSB) to develop consistent climate-related financial risk disclosures for use by companies, banks, and investors.\n- The main objective of TCFD reporting is to disclose the climate-related risks and opportunities of a company as well as the financial impact those might have on the company\u2019s business.\n- TCFD reporting aims to provide consistent and transparent information to all financial actors and global markets.\n- It is not a corporate reporting standard but a way of understanding how firms approach the financial risks and opportunities related to climate change. \u200d\nWho is subject to TCFD-aligned reporting?\n- The TCFD is still mainly a voluntary framework for companies of all sizes, industries and jurisdictions.\n- More and more countries are looking into making TCFD-aligned climate-risk reporting mandatory .\n\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 Mandatory TCFD-aligned reporting in the UK\n- As of April 2022, UK companies with the following criteria are obligated to submit TCFD-aligned reporting:\n\u25e6 All UK companies that are currently required to produce a non-financial information statement;\n\u25e6 UK registered companies with securities admitted to AIM with more than 500 employees;\n\u25e6 UK registered companies which are not included in the categories above but have more than 500 employees and a turnover of more than \u00a3500m;\n\u25e6 LLPs have more than 500 employees and a turnover of more than\u00a0\u00a3500m.\nWhat do companies disclose in their TCFD-aligned report?\n- A TCFD-aligned report should contain all relevant information on a company\u2019s climate-related risks and opportunities as well as the resulting financial impacts of those.\u00a0\n- Companies should disclose the relevant information within the framework of the four recommended core subjects for a TCFD-aligned report:\n\u25e6 Governance : The organisation\u2019s governance around climate-related risks and opportunities;\n\u25e6 Strategy : The actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organisation\u2019s businesses, strategy, and financial planning;\n\u25e6 Risk Management : The processes used by the organisation to identify, assess, and manage climate-related risks;\n\u25e6 Metrics & Targets : The metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant climate-related risks and opportunities. \u200d\nWhere and when do companies need to disclose their TCFD-aligned report?\n- The TCFD-aligned reports are to be published together with a company\u2019s mainstream financial filings.\n- TCFD-aligned reports shall be issued within four months of the end of a company\u2019s financial year-end.\nKeep up with climate risk disclosure by reporting on the TCFD.

The first report was to be disclosed for the financial year of 2018.\nWhich companies have to comply with the NFRD?\nThe NFRD applies to approximately 11 700 companies and groups across the European Union , including companies that:\n- Are a large undertaking , exceeding 2 out of 3 of the following criteria for two successive accounting periods:\n\u25cb A balance sheet total of EUR 20 million, or\n\u25cb A net turnover of EUR 40 million, or\n\u25cb Average number of employees of 500.\n- Are a public-interest entity , meaning any entity which is:\n\u25cb Trading transferable securities on the regulated market of any Member State, or\n\u25cb A credit institution, or\n\u25cb An insurance undertaking, or\n\u25cb Designated by a Member States as a public interest entity (more info on how the Member States define the scope here ).\nWhat do companies need to disclose under the NFRD?\nThe non-financial report should include:\n- A brief description of the undertaking's business model;\n- A description of the policies pursued by the undertaking in relation to ESG matters, including due diligence processes implemented;\n- The outcome of those policies;\n- Non-financial key performance indicators relevant to the particular business, across:\n\u25cb Environmental matters\n\u25cb Social matters and treatment of employees\n\u25cb Respect for human rights\n\u25cb Anti-corruption and bribery\n\u25cb Diversity on company boards (in terms of age, gender, educational and professional background)\n- The principal risks related to those matters.\nA timeline about the NFRD implementation: \u200d\n- In 2017 the EU published guidelines to help companies disclose environmental and social information in their non-financial report.\n- In 2019 the EU published additional guidelines on reporting climate-related information in a non-financial report.\n- These EU guidelines are not mandatory and companies may decide to use international, European or national guidelines according to their own characteristics or business environment.\n- The first CSRD report of companies in scope of NFRD is due in 2025 for the financial year of 2024.\nWhat comes next?\nThe NFRD is in the process of being amended by the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). The CSRD will amend the scope and the reporting requirements of the NFRD. In other words, the CSRD will replace the NFRD.\n\ud83d\udca1 Important for companies reporting on the NFRD: The first CSRD report of companies in scope of NFRD is due in 2025 for the financial year of 2024 .\nSince the CSRD has been officially approved and adopted by the EU Council, it is just a matter of time before the NFRD is replaced by the CSRD.

This change aims to provide investors with consistent, comparable, and decision-useful information for making informed investment decisions. In this article, we will discuss what companies will need to disclose, who is subject to the SEC Climate-Related Disclosures, and when companies will have to start reporting.\nThe SEC's Climate-Related Disclosures Proposal\nOn 21 March 2022, the SEC proposed rule changes that would require companies in scope to include information about climate-related risks likely to have a material impact on their business, results of operations, or financial condition, and certain climate-related financial statement metrics. These proposed disclosures are similar to those many companies already provide based on broadly accepted disclosure frameworks, such as the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures and the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.\nWhat will have to be disclosed?\nCompanies will be required to disclose the following:\n- Climate-related risks and their actual or likely material impacts on the registrant\u2019s business and strategy\n- The registrant\u2019s governance of climate-related risks and relevant risk management processes;\n- The registrant\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, including Scope 1 and 2 for all, and Scope 3 emissions if material or if the registrant has set a GHG emissions reduction target that includes Scope 3 emissions;\n- Certain climate-related financial statement metrics and related disclosures in a note to the registrant\u2019s audited financial statements;\n- Information about climate-related targets and goals and transition plan, if any.\nWho is subject to the SEC Climate-Related Disclosures?\nThe SEC Climate-Related Disclosure Rules will be applicable to all SEC registrants. In the United States, there are around 12,000 companies registered with the SEC , all of whom will be expected to comply.\nNote: Registrant is a term used in reference to any company that files documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) . The term applies to companies conducting initial public offerings (IPO) and companies that file periodic reports.\nWhen will companies have to start reporting?\nThe proposed rules have not yet been finalised or implemented. After the SEC published their proposal on 15 March 2021, they opened it for public comments. The comment period ended on 24 June 2021. Due to the amount of public comments, the SEC had to let go of the original implementation timeline of a phased-in approach that would have started in 2024 for the financial year 2023 for large accelerated filers. The SEC has not yet announced a timeline for when the final rules will be released or when they will become effective.\nThe SEC's proposed climate-related disclosures aim to provide investors with vital information to make informed investment decisions. Companies should start preparing for these changes by familiarising themselves with the proposed disclosures and assessing their current reporting practices to ensure they are ready when the final rules are implemented.\nFurther readings\nFor more information, refer to the official proposal by the SEC and the SEC\u2019s factsheet .\nThe SEC's proposed climate-related disclosure rules have the potential to significantly impact the way companies report on climate-related risks and opportunities. Investors stand to benefit from more consistent, comparable, and decision-useful information, enabling them to make better-informed investment decisions. As we await the finalization and implementation of these proposed rules, companies should start assessing their current climate-related disclosures and consider the potential implications of the new requirements.\nDon't wait for the final rules to take action.

It requires suppliers to assess, disclose, and mitigate climate-related risks to their operations, products, and services.\nDownload Policy Factsheet\nBack to Policy Centre\nThe Biden-Harris Administration has placed considerable emphasis on combating climate change and promoting sustainable practices. As a result, businesses and contractors working with the federal government must be prepared to adapt and comply with new climate regulations.\nOne such regulation is the proposed Federal Supplier Climate Risks and Resilience Rule, which aims to protect the federal government's supply chains from significant climate-related financial risks. In this article, we will provide an overview of the Rule, outline its requirements, and discuss the steps companies need to take to ensure compliance.\nAbout the Federal Supplier Climate Risks and Resilience Rule\nThe Federal Supplier Climate Risks and Resilience Rule was proposed on November 10, 2022, as part of the Biden Administration's goal to achieve net-zero emissions procurement by 2050.\nThis Rule requires large federal government contractors to disclose their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions , climate-related financial risks, and set science-based emissions reduction targets.\nWho is in scope of the Rule?\nThe Rule applies to federal contractors who receive the highest volumes of annual federal agency contract obligations. The regulation differentiates between two types of contractors:\n- Significant contractors: those who received between $7.5 million and $50 million in federal contract obligations during the previous federal fiscal year.\n- Major contractors: those who received more than $50 million in federal contract obligations during the previous federal fiscal year.\u2028\nContractors that are not subject to the Rule include higher education institutions, non-profit research entities, and state or local governments.\nWhat are the requirements for the companies falling under the scope?\n- Complete a Greenhouse Gas Emissions inventory , which applies to both significant and major contractors. This inventory should include annual Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions following the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard.\n- Submit annual climate disclosures , which apply only to major contractors that are not small businesses. These disclosures should align with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and be completed through relevant portions of the CDP Climate Change Questionnaire.\n- Set Science-Based Targets for GHG emissions reduction , applicable to major contractors that are not small businesses. These targets must be validated by the Science Based Targets initiative.\nWhen will companies have to start reporting?\n- The proposed rules have not yet been finalised or implemented, with a final rule expected within 2023.\n- Companies will need to publish a GHG inventory and disclosure of total annual Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions within one year after the publication of the final Rule.\n- The requirement to disclose annual climate disclosures and Science Based Targets will apply beginning two years after the final Rule's publication.\nAs the US Federal Supplier Climate Risks and Resilience Rule moves closer to implementation , businesses and organisations should stay informed and prepare to adapt to the new requirements. Compliance with this Rule will not only reduce climate-related financial risks but also contribute to a more sustainable and resilient economy. Business leaders must proactively embrace these changes and lead their organisations toward a greener and more environmentally responsible future.\nReady to take the next step towards sustainability and compliance with the latest climate regulations?

This mandatory legislation, set to take effect by 2025 or 2026, applies to both EU and non-EU companies operating in the EU, particularly targeting those in high-risk industries.\nDownload Policy Factsheet\nBack to Policy Centre\nThe European Union (EU) has always been at the forefront of encouraging corporate responsibility and sustainability. Continuing this trend, the EU introduced the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) in March 2021. The directive aims to ensure that companies take proactive measures to respect human rights and mitigate environmental impacts within their operations and supply chains.\nWhat is the CSDD Directive?\nThe CSDD Directive is a piece of legislation designed to enforce respect for human rights and the environment throughout the entire supply chain of businesses. Although several EU member countries have due diligence legislation in place, these laws are typically voluntary and often sector-specific or only address single aspects such as child labour. The CSDD Directive aims to bring a more comprehensive and mandatory approach to corporate sustainability in the region.\nWho falls under the scope of the CSDDD?\nThe CSDDD will directly apply to both EU and non-EU companies .\nFor EU-based companies, the directive applies to those with more than 500 employees and a turnover exceeding \u20ac150M. Alternatively, companies with over 250 employees and a \u20ac40M turnover also fall under the directive, provided that 50% of their revenue comes from high-risk industries like fashion, minerals, or agriculture.\nNon-EU companies operating within the EU also fall under the scope of the CSDDD. This includes third-country companies active in the EU that meet the turnover thresholds aligned with the above-mentioned groups, with the revenue being generated in the EU, irrespective of whether they have a branch or subsidiary in the region.\nThe European Union (EU) expects the Directive to directly impact around 13,000 companies within the EU and approximately 4,000 outside the EU .\nWhat will companies need to do?\nThe CSDD Directive mandates that companies falling under its scope:\n- Identify the principal adverse impact on the environment and human rights resulting from their operations, subsidiaries, and supply chains.\n- Mitigate identified risks within their operations and supply chain, supported by an action plan and a timeline to address the identified risks.\n- Establish grievance mechanisms for workers and stakeholders to raise issues if they arise.\n- Align their business model and strategy with the 1.5\u00b0C target of the Paris Agreement, specifically for large companies.\n- Publicly report on their due diligence via a sustainability report or website.\nWhat's next?\nOn February 23 2022, the EU Commission adopted a proposal for the Directive on corporate sustainability due diligence. The proposal is currently awaiting approval from the European Parliament and Council, with a final adoption expected within 2023 . Once formally adopted, Member States will have two years to transpose the CSDDD into domestic law. It is anticipated that companies will have to start applying the requirements by 2025 or 2026.\nTo learn more about this directive, you can read the proposal by the EU Commission.\nIn summary, the EU's Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) is an important step towards more sustainable and ethical business practices in the region. Companies falling under the scope of this directive should start preparing for these changes to ensure compliance when they come into effect.\nLooking to stay ahead of the curve and ensure your company meets the requirements of the EU's CSDD Directive?

It helps investors, consumers, policymakers, and other stakeholders evaluate large companies' non-financial performance. Thus, it encourages these companies to develop more responsible approaches to business. For instance, it radically changes companies' scope and type of sustainability reporting. With the CSRD, the European Commission defines a common reporting framework for non-financial data for the first time.\nAdopted as part of the comprehensive Sustainable Finance Package on 21 April 2021, the CSRD entered into force on 5 January 2023 . This directive expands the scope of sustainability reporting, affecting approximately 50,000 companies across Europe , with the aim to standardise non-financial data reporting.\nOn 28 November 2022, the European Union Council gave its final approval to the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) . Following the Council\u2019s approval of the European Parliament's position, the CSRD legislative act was adopted.\nCompliance is happening soon: companies must submit their report aligning with the CSRD on 1 January 2025, for the 2024 financial year. It will be challenging for reporting companies, as data collection and auditing is an arduous process requiring time and resources. If your company is not familiar (yet) with this regulation and you are wondering, \"does my company needs to comply?\" then it is time to become an expert on the topic, and on that side, we have you covered.\nWhat is the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)?\nTo help improve money flow towards sustainable activities across the European Union, the European Commission adopted the ambitious and comprehensive Sustainable Finance Package on 21 April 2021. One of the proposed measures within the package is the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) .\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nThe Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive extends the scope and reporting requirements of the already existing Non-Financial Reporting Directive - a regulatory framework that mandates sizeable public interest entities to report on their sustainability performance since 2018.\nThis new legislation comes into play as Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) reporting gains momentum. There is evidence that companies' information is not sufficient in the reporting. According to the European Commission , \"reports often omit information that investors and other stakeholders think is important\". Reported information can be difficult to benchmark from company to company, and users are often unsure whether they can trust it. For example, investors need to assess this information to report under the SFRD and channel money to sustainable activities.\nWith its new requirements, the EU is tackling the problem of quality reporting by establishing a common reporting framework. Also, the CSRD aims to ensure that businesses report reliable and comparable sustainability information to re-orient investments towards more sustainable technologies and companies.\nNFRD versus CSRD: differences and action points \u00a0 \u00a0\nWhile both directives aim to enhance transparency and contribute to a more sustainable economy, the CSRD expands the reporting requirements, company types, and provides a more harmonised framework for reporting. The CSRD also calls for an audit of the sustainability information that companies report, contributing to more reliable data and increased trust among stakeholders.\nDifferences between NFRD and CSRD\nCredit: Plan A\nWhich companies have to comply with the CSRD?\nWhile the NFRD only requires \"public interest entities\" with more than 500 employees to report on their sustainability performance, the CSRD is requiring all large companies - meaning companies with more than 250 employees and more than \u20ac50 Million in turnover and/or more than \u20ac25 Million in total assets - and all listed companies (except micro-enterprises, less than 10 employees or below \u20ac20M in turnover) to report on their sustainability.\nAs soon as put into force, nearly 50,000 companies (15,000 in Germany alone) in the EU will need to follow detailed EU sustainability reporting standards , corresponding to 75% of all EU companies turnover.\nWhich information will have to be disclosed?\nAdditional to the NFRD Under Directive 2014/95/EU, large companies have to publish information related to:\n- Environmental protection\n- Social responsibility and treatment of employees\n- Respect for human rights\n- Anti-corruption and bribery and\n- Diversity on company boards\nAlso, the CSRD is adding additional requirements on:\n- Double materiality concept: It includes sustainability risks (like climate change) that affect the company and the company's impact on society and the environment.\n- Companies will need to report on their process of selecting material topics for stakeholders.\n- More forward-looking information , such as targets and progress, must be included in reports.\n- Companies must disclose information relating to intangible assets , like social, human, and intellectual capital.\n- Reporting in line with Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) and the EU Taxonomy Regulation. \u200d\n- Businesses will correspondingly have to start reporting how sustainability risks might affect their performance .\nWhile the EU provides voluntary reporting guidelines for NFRD reports, the CSRD introduces more detailed reporting requirements and requirements to report according to mandatory EU sustainability reporting standards. The CSRD reporting will align with the already existing Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation and the EU Taxonomy.\nLearn more about the EU Taxonomy with Plan A's Whitepaper .\nWhat are the next steps?\nOn 28 November 2022, the European Union Council gave its final approval to the corporate sustainability reporting directive (CSRD) . Following the Council\u2019s approval of the European Parliament's position, the CSRD legislative act is adopted.\nAfter being signed by the President of the European Parliament and the President of the Council, it was published in the Official Journal of the European Union and has entered into force on 5 January 2023. The new rules will need to be implemented by member states 18 months later. Here are the next steps and what to expect:\n- End of 2023 : EU Member States will have to adopt the EU Directive into national law.\n- January 1, 2024 : Companies within the scope of CSRD and currently reporting under the NFRD will be obliged to report their FY 2024 data in 2025. As of the beginning of 2024, all other large EU companies within the scope of CSRD are obliged to report.\n- January 1, 2025 : Businesses already subject to the NFRD will have to start reporting in the financial year 2024. \u200d\n- January 1, 2026 : SMEs listed on a regulated market (no micro-enterprises) obliged to report for FY 2025 (but under less stringent reporting requirements).\n- January 1, 2028 : Small and medium enterprises and small and non-complex credit institutions, and captive insurance undertakings will have to start reporting for the financial year 2027 - with a further possibility of voluntary opt-out until 2028. The reporting standards for SMEs will be lighter. \u200d\n- January 1, 2029: Non-European companies that have branches or subsidiaries in the EU with a net turnover of \u20ac150M in the EU will have to start reporting.\nCan companies get sanctioned if they are not complying?\nIt is unknown exactly when the EU Commission will sanction businesses failing to comply with the CSRD. According to the Commissions' requirements within the Directive, the sanctions can be expected to be significant .\nThe nature of the sanctions and the fines' amount will depend on the different Member States. For example, if German businesses don't report compliance to the German version of the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (the Directive being amended with the CSRD) they face fines up to the amount which is the highest of the following: \u20ac10M or 5 % of the total annual turnover of the company or twice the amount of the profits gained or losses avoided because of the breach.\nOn the other hand, French businesses face no fines if they don't report according to the NFRD unless an interested party asks for the disclosure of the non-financial information. If it is not available, subsequently, financial penalties can be imposed by a judge.\nWhat does the CSRD mean for businesses?\nyour company must comply with the CSRD, it is crucial to take proactive steps. Preparation should begin immediately, as the timeline for compliance is fast approaching. To navigate the requirements and understand which data must be collected and when to disclose it, consider seeking expert advice.\nIt is not easy to stay on top of the requirements and understand which data must be collected and when to disclose it.

Nowadays, more and more companies pledge to become carbon neutral, net-zero or even climate positive. With global giants like Google, who claims that they are the first company to eliminate its carbon legacy, we may ask: how is it possible?\u00a0\nTerms like \"carbon-neutrality\", \"net-zero\" or \"climate positive\" have been around for a while, but for the last couple of years, small startups to global corporations have integrated them, mainly for mainstream marketing purposes. The diversity of phrases and the lack of clarity around them can mislead well-intentioned consumers. However, communicating transparently about them may encourage businesses to be more proactive.\nRead our article \u201cHow to spot greenwashing\u201d\nAccording to the targets set by the Paris Climate Agreement, there are only 29 years remaining to reach global net-zero emissions. So let\u2019s understand better what the lingo around carbon neutrality is.\u00a0To verify if a company is willing to reduce or even erase their carbon footprint when they are claiming carbon-neutrality, it is vital to comprehend these terms.\nTo start, let's deep dive into the core of carbon-neutrality:\n- Carbon neutral\u00a0means that any CO 2 released into the atmosphere from a company's activities is balanced by an equivalent amount being removed.\n- Climate positive\u00a0means that activity goes beyond achieving net-zero carbon emissions to create an environmental benefit by removing additional carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\n- Carbon negative\u00a0means the same thing as \u201cclimate positive.\u201d\n- Carbon positive\u00a0is\u00a0how organisations describe climate positive and carbon negative. It\u2019s mainly a marketing term, and understandably confusing\u2013we generally avoid it.\n- Climate Neutral refers to reducing all GHG to the point of zero while eliminating all other negative environmental impacts that an organisation may cause.\n- Net-Zero carbon emissions mean that an activity releases net-zero carbon emissions into the atmosphere.\n- Net-Zero emissions balance the whole amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) released and the amount removed from the atmosphere.\nWorld leaders rejoicing at the adoption of the Paris Agreement\n(Credit: UNFCCC)\nWhat is carbon-neutrality?\nCarbon neutral was the New Oxford American Dictionary \u2018s word of the year in 2006 \u2013 and since then, has been catapulted into the mainstream world. By definition, carbon-neutral (or carbon neutrality) is the balance between emitting carbon and absorbing carbon emissions from carbon sinks . Or simply, eliminate all carbon emissions altogether. Carbon sinks are any systems that absorb more carbon than they emit, such as forests, soils and oceans.\nAccording to the European Union Commission, natural sinks remove between 9.5 and 11 Gt of CO 2 per year . To date, no artificial carbon sinks can remove carbon from the atmosphere on the necessary scale to fight global warming. Hence, to become carbon-neutral, companies have two options: reducing drastically their carbon emissions to net-zero or balancing their emissions through offsetting and the purchase of carbon credits.\nWhat does it mean to become carbon-neutral?\nBecoming carbon neutral is the new mantra of Wall Street and worldwide companies, but how to make it happen? As experts in the field, Plan A advises companies to apply a carbon accounting framework to the initiative they are trying to address. First, we advise you to calculate your company\u2019s carbon footprint, which you can do easily with our Carbon accounting software.\nOnce the total carbon footprint is calculated, you will have a better sense of how much your company's need to counteract. Then, reduce carbon emissions by analysing the worst carbon indicators - where your company emit the most and acting upon it. Finally, offset what\u2019s left.\u00a0\nIt is impossible to generate zero-carbon emissions; therefore , offsetting is a viable approach to become carbon-neutral.\u00a0Offsetting your carbon emissions sends a strong message to your community, that you are committed to paving the way for a sustainable future. The funds from neutralising your carbon footprint will be providing low-carbon technology to communities most at risk of the impacts of climate change. However, you have to ensure that the offsetting project is transparent and involves local communities in the process.\nWhats is the difference between Carbon neutral and Net-zero ?\nAs established previously, carbon-neutral and net-zero are two similar terms. In both cases, companies are working to reduce and balance their carbon footprint. When carbon-neutral refers to balancing out the total amount of carbon emissions , net-zero carbon means no carbon was emitted from the get-go, so no carbon needs to be captured or offset . For example, a company's building running entirely on solar, and using zero fossil fuels can label its energy as \u201czero carbon.\u201d\nHowever, when referring to \"net-zero\", it is crucial to specify net-zero carbon or emissions . On the contrary, net-zero emissions refer to the overall balance of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) produced and GHG emissions taken out of the atmosphere. Even if the scientific concept is often applied to countries like the US, China, it can also be used for organisations . In other words, net-zero\u00a0describes the point in time where humans stop adding to the burden of climate-heating gases in the atmosphere .\nCarbon negative or Climate positive: doing more for the planet\u00a0\nIKEA aims to become \u201cclimate positive\u201d by 2030.\nCredit: Oleg Laptev\nCarbon Negative and climate positive are two similar terms. It occurs when a company removes or capture more CO 2 from the atmosphere than it even emits. Then, the company has a negative amount of carbon emissions and positively impacts the climate .\u00a0\nSo let\u2019s go deeper: to become climate positive, a company needs to understand exactly what its carbon footprint is . For example, if the North Face wants to launch a carbon-positive beanie, they would need to calculate the product's total carbon footprint: from the energy required to produce and distribute a product, to the emissions associated with sourcing and production, and end-to-life products. The company would need also to tackle additional measures to capture more carbon .\nTo do so, there is only one way: calculate the scopes 1, 2 and 3 of carbon emissions . And you are in luck because Plan A Sustainability Platform calculates all three scopes emissions scopes, enabling companies to reduce significantly their emissions.\nAs becoming carbon neutral or climate positive for companies is soon become the new trend or new gold, some firms are already seeing further and tend to erase the totality of their historical footprint. Microsoft was one of the first major companies to make the announcement, quickly followed by Google.\u00a0\nAs the EU aims to become the first continent to become carbon neutral, companies and individuals must rapidly reduce their carbon footprint. Now that you are familiar with the terms carbon-neutral, climate positive and net-zero; it is time to achieve your next sustainable step: calculating and reducing your company's carbon footprint.\nVisit our website . We have the solution for you. Our Sustainability Software helps you to calculate, monitor and reduce your carbon footprint. You can become carbon neutral by offsetting the rest of your emissions through our certified partners.

Why do certain startups seem to always outperform and get ahead of the cohort? The secret lies in a crucial acronym: ESG . Irrespective of your standing as an investor or a company, mastering the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) framework is vital to maintaining pace with the market trends of 2023 and managing your bill.\nIn that sense, ESG is not only a framework that financial institutions and investors have to report on, it is also on the radar of employees, regulators and everyone involved in the ecosystem. Why? Simply because phenomena such as the coronavirus outbreak and climate change made us realise that we are not masters of our planet but rather stewards of nature . ESG is taking on an even greater significance in light of recent events: companies have the responsibility and resources to accomplish positive climate action, building a more sustainable, resilient future and \u201cputting money where their mouth is\u201d.\nIt is essential to state that to meet the goal of limiting the global temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C, $90tn of investment is needed by 2030 . Now, let\u2019s dive into the ESG topic and the great importance that it has for companies and investors.\nESG reporting for investors: the Whitepaper\nTo help investors, financial institutions, and companies understand better the underlying criteria to implement and report on them, we created a Whitepaper on ESG reporting and its fundamentals . Download the Whitepaper from the form below and access this exclusive ESG resource directly. Let us know your comments and suggestions.\n\u200d\nWhat is Environmental, Social, Governance (ESG)?\nBy definition, ESG reporting is the disclosure of data explaining a company's impact and added value in three areas: environment, social and corporate governance. ESG is the umbrella term for sustainable and responsible finance components . It is a framework considering environmental, social and governance factors alongside financial factors in the investment decision-making process . It is also a process to assess which companies perform/score on each of the factors: E, S & G, while determining if it is a viable investment. \u201c It\u2019s not just 5 percent of your money you give away that matters. What you do with the other 95 per cent is almost more important.\u201d\nDarren Walker - President of the Ford Foundation\nWhat does environmental mean in ESG?\nEnvironmental (E) assesses how a company performs as a steward of nature. It analyses how its activities impact the environment and manage environmental risks. It includes both direct operations and across the supply chain. For example, resource scarcity and management, natural resources preservation, animal treatment and greenhouse gas emissions.\nWhat does social mean in ESG?\nSocial criteria (S) examines the strengths and weaknesses of how a company manages relationships with employees, suppliers, customers, and the communities where it operates. For example, these criteria include working conditions, operations in conflict regions, health and safety, employee relations and diversity.\nWhat does governance mean in ESG?\nGovernance (G) deals with a company\u2019s leadership, executive pay, audits, internal controls, and shareholder rights. Investors want to know if they can trust the company and what kind of decisions are taken behind closed doors. It includes executive pay, gender equity / equal pay, bribery and corruption, and board diversity.\nThe importance of ESG for companies and investors\nThe practice of ESG investing began in the 1960s. ESG investing evolved from socially responsible investing (SRI), which excluded stocks or entire industries from investments related to business operations such as tobacco, guns, or goods from conflicted regions. The term ESG was coined in 2004 by former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan and resulted in 2005 with the first study, \u201c Who cares Wins \u201d, developed jointly with the world\u2019s largest institutional investors and banks.\nNow, ESG is rapidly growing and evolving, as many investors look to incorporate ESG factors into the investment process. As a fact, the ESG market is already set to double this year. Also, the \"Portfolio Decarbonisation Coalition\", a United Nations-sponsored group of 27 primarily European institutional investors and asset managers controlling $3.2 trillion in assets, has committed $600 billion to fund green projects and investments . ESG is likely to play a bigger role in how companies are assessed, not only by investors but by consumers and stakeholders.\nNathan Bonnisseau - Co founder at Plan A\nOn the legal side, European regulations are pushing for robust implementation of ESG factors within the financial sector and everywhere else. The ESG framework is pushed within the EU as it is a mechanism that will support the green deal and ensure the implementation of a more sustainable economy. \" ESG is likely to play a bigger role in how companies are assessed, not only by investors but by consumers and stakeholders \u201d, explains Nathan Bonisseau, co-Founder at Plan A . \u201cThe numbers reflect a growing awareness that companies must manage their environmental impact in innovative ways in order to remain successful. Sustainability is the new ideal, and the development of sophisticated methods of evaluating ESG activities and effect, is the key to attaining it,\u201d he adds.\nRegulations impacting ESG\nThe mounting pressure to implement ESG factors comes from legislators, investors and the business ecosystem (e.g media, consumers, stakeholders, customers). To remain attractive as an employer or a brand, companies have to perform well on ESG. As an example, 49% of millennial millionaires make their investments based on social factors . Therefore, it is essential for VC\u2019s, startups and tech companies to anticipate the law .\u00a0\nLooking at how the wind is turning around the regulatory framework in the financial sector, ESG adoption may soon be compulsory or mandatory. To stay ahead of regulations and competition, companies must integrate this framework at their core. Organisations failing to comply with environmental or social factors may struggle with regulatory, legal or reputation issues later.\n- The European Union SFDR (Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation) entered into force on March 11, 2021. It imposes mandatory ESG disclosure obligations for asset managers and other financial markets participants with substantive provisions.\n- The EU Sustainable Finance Action Plan : A significant policy objective by the European Union to promote sustainable investment across the continent. Parts of it are effective from March 2021. The aim is to reorient capital flows towards sustainable investment and away from sectors contributing to climate change, such as fossil fuels.\n- The EU Taxonomy : The European Union Taxonomy is arguably the most ambitious text aiming to give a non-financial overall score covering all facets of sustainability, from ESG to biodiversity and pollution treatment. The EU taxonomy is a classification system establishing a list of environmentally sustainable economic activities. For investors, companies and financial institutions\u2014the regulation defines which economic activities qualify as sustainable and evaluate their environmental performance. From January 2022, financial market participants are required to report how and to what extent their financial products align with the EU Taxonomy, a framework to classify environmentally sustainable economic activities\nHow does ESG create value?\nSince 2019, European investors poured \u20ac120 billion into sustainable investment options , demonstrating that something interesting is stirring: VCs and investors are increasingly interested in how startups are scoring on their ESG policies and practices. There are many scenarios in which the pressure to implement ESG in your company comes from. For example, suppose you are a startup founder and looking actively for funding - you will have better chances to convince investors if your company has already implemented ESG policies and performs well on these factors.\nOn one hand, it has been demonstrated that companies performing on ESG practices have higher financial growth and optimisation , lower volatility, higher employee productivity, reduced regulatory and legal interventions (fines and sanctions), top-line growth, and cost reductions. On the other hand, companies that performed poorly on ESG noticed a higher cost of capital, higher volatility due to controversies and other incidences such as labour strikes, fraud accounting and other governance irregularities. So you rather jump on this train if you do not want to be left behind.\nWhy is it inevitable?\nThere is an increasing awareness that ESG may become compulsory or mandatory . For companies to stay ahead of regulations, competition and unleash all the benefits of ESG,\u00a0 they must integrate this framework at the core of their DNA. In another perspective, organisations that fail to comply with environmental or social factors may end up struggling to deal with regulatory, legal or reputation issues at a later stage.\u00a0\nThe best course of action for your business is to adopt a methodology that reflects sustainability and ESG.

One of the proposed measures within the package is the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) .\u00a0\nThe CSRD has now officially been adopted by the European Union Council and amends the scope and the reporting requirements of the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) . While the NFRD only provided guidelines for ESG reporting, the CSRD introduces mandatory reporting standards for all large businesses.\nWhat is the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)?\nThe CSRD aims to improve the transparency and consistency of sustainability reporting by companies operating in the EU. It is part of a broader trend towards increased disclosure and transparency around climate-related risks and opportunities, and can play an important role in promoting sustainable development and climate resilience. The regulatory framework mandates that public interest entities report on their sustainability performance since 2018, and must be reported on within the 2024 reporting year.\u00a0\nWith its new requirements, the CSRD aims to ensure that businesses report reliable and comparable sustainability information so that investors can re-orient investments towards more sustainable technologies and industries. In addition to the NFRD disclosures, a company must disclose the following:\n- Environmental protection\n- Social responsibility and treatment of employees\n- Respect for human rights\n- Anti-corruption and bribery\n- Diversity on company boards\nWho needs to comply with the CSRD?\nThe CSRD will require more than 50,000 European companies to follow detailed sustainability reporting standards, this corresponds to 75% of all EU companies' turnover.\nSuch regulatory efforts, which aim to increase visibility on issues ranging from companies\u2019 greenhouse-gas emissions to gender pay differences, will also require at least 10,000 companies outside the EU to disclose their sustainability performance. According to financial data firm Refinitiv, about a third of CSRD-affected firms outside of the EU are U.S based companies. Meanwhile, a Refinitiv analysis has identified that of the several thousand companies subject to the coming EU rules, 13% are Canadian and 11% are British.\nNon-EU countries expected to be impacted by the EU\u2019s sustainability rules; broken down by home country.\nCredit: Refinitiv\nSo, which companies are actually required to comply with the CSRD?\nWhile the NFRD only requires companies with more than 500 employees to report on their sustainability performance, the CSRD mandates that all large companies report on their sustainability.\u00a0\nSpecifically, within the European Union:\n- Companies with more than 250 employees and/or more than \u20ac40M turnover and/or more than \u20ac20 Million in total assets - and all listed companies (except micro-enterprises) will need to comply.\nMeanwhile, the companies outside of the EU that the rules will apply to include:\n- Non-European companies with branches or subsidiaries with a net turnover of \u20ac 150 million in the EU.\n- Companies outside of the EU that have listed securities, such as stocks or bonds, on a regulated market in the European Union\n- Companies outside of the EU that have annual EU revenue of more than \u20ac150 million, or about $163 million, and an EU branch with net revenue of more than \u20ac40 million\n- Companies outside of the EU with an EU subsidiary that is a large company, defined as meeting at least two of these three criteria: more than 250 EU-based employees, a balance sheet above \u20ac20 million or local revenue of more than \u20ac40 million\nDownload our factsheet on the CSRD\nWhen does the CSRD apply?\nThe following timeline provides an overview of when the CSRD will affect businesses::\n- 2025: Businesses already subject to the NFRD will have to start reporting on the financial year 2024.\n- 2026: Large undertakings not currently subject to the NFRD will have to start reporting on the financial year 2025.\n- 2027: Small and medium enterprises and small and non-complex credit institutions and captive insurance undertakings will have to start reporting for the financial year 2026 - with a further possibility of voluntary opt-out until 2028.\n- 2029: Non-European companies that have branches or subsidiaries will have to start reporting.\n6 critical steps to prepare for the CSRD\n6 steps to comply with the CSRD\nCredit:\u00a0Plan\u00a0A\n1. Set up and prepare a double materiality assessment\nOne of the key impacts of the CSRD which differs from current legislation is the requirement of a materiality analysis, via a double materiality approach. To carry out the double materiality assessment, all stakeholders and levels of the value chain must be evaluated, and the assessment should consider the short, medium, and long-term impacts of the business\u2019 operations.\nBusinesses who wish to not only avoid risk, but develop an effective and impactful sustainability strategy, must ensure they perform a thorough materiality assessment. Yet, given the administratively challenging and time-consuming nature of materiality assessments, businesses impacted by the CSRD must not only take action immediately, but also utilise expert technology - such as Plan A\u2019s comprehensive decarbonisation platform - to ensure they are ready for 2024.\u00a0\u00a0\n2. Develop a comprehensive understanding of the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRSs)\nCSRD-impacted businesses must start familiarising themselves with the exposure drafts of the mandatory reporting standards of the CSRD, the European Sustainability Reporting Standards . Businesses will be required to meet these standards, therefore it is crucial that\u00a0a comprehensive understanding of the requirements is ascertained.\u00a0\n3. Collect and monitor data\u00a0\nBusinesses must collect data from their own operations, suppliers, and business partners to be included in their sustainability reports. For the first time, the CSRD will adopt an EU-wide audit (assurance) requirement pertaining to ESG information. As such, CSRD-impacted businesses will be required to carry out due diligence practices and audits on their operations, such as reporting on scopes 1,2 and 3 of their carbon emissions.\u00a0\nHowever, such qualified data on its own is likely to not be enough to successfully comply with the CSRD. The data collection process utilised by businesses must be extremely reliable in order to ensure the sustainability claims relating to various suppliers, operators, and business partners is supported with reliable data and clear documentation. The most efficient way to streamline the data collection and analysis process is to utilise Plan A\u2019s carbon accounting software which allows businesses to save valuable time and resources.\u00a0\nStreamline the data collection process using Plan A\u2019s comprehensive carbon accounting and decarbonisation platform . Credit: Plan A\n4. Align risk management with the business\u2019 sustainability strategy\nBusinesses who comprehensively engage with the risk factors relating to sustainability from an early stage will be able to better align efforts with sustainability, their business value, and risk mitigation interventions. Research by Sustainalytics found that high to severe ESG incidents lead to 6% loss of market capitalisation on average; further emphasising the importance of aligning risk analysis with sustainability strategy. Meanwhile, the double materiality concept also considers the business impact that sustainability topics could have on the company's reputation and eventually their licence to operate, thus making this assessment a vital component to developing an impactful sustainability strategy.\u00a0\n5. Integrate reporting\nTo ensure that the overall management report that CSRD-affected businesses are required to publish is transparent and effective, It is highly encouraged that the guidelines of a reporting framework are closely followed. Utilising a reporting framework as a guide will ensure businesses can go beyond the minimum requirements in communicating their sustainability performance, thus meeting the growing demands of stakeholders. Meanwhile, CSRD-affected companies must also ensure that their reports are able to be accessed digitally and that they are verified via an independent audit.\nA guide to ESG and Sustainability reporting frameworks which companies should utilise in conjunction with the reporting requirements of the CSRD in order to accelerate their net-zero journey.\n\u200d Read more about ESG reporting here.\u00a0\n6. Voluntarily comply as soon as possible\nA fundamental step to not only preparing for the CSRD, but also effectively integrating sustainability into overall business processes, is abiding by such requirements on a voluntary basis. Regardless of whether businesses are currently under the scope of the CSRD, these requirements should be used as a rule-of-thumb to ensure sustainability becomes a pillar of the business\u2019 operations as early as possible. This will not only be key to ensuring affected businesses are prepared for 2024, but also ensuring that non-affected businesses transition sustainably to ensure they are prepared for future compliance.\nThe vast requirements of the CSRD ultimately aim to ensure that businesses integrate reliable and comparable sustainability information into a verified reporting format. In doing so, investors will be able to re-orient resources towards more sustainable technologies and industries; accelerating the global journey towards net-zero. The risk of financial penalties, administrative sanctions and legal proceedings for companies who do not comply with the CSRD ultimately means businesses must take action immediately. Meanwhile, financial and non-financial benefits of sustainable transition makes decarbonisation a \u2018no-brainer\u2019 for businesses of all sizes around the globe.\u00a0\nTo be fully prepared, businesses should start collecting data now. Plan A provides a comprehensive carbon accounting and decarbonisation platform that allows businesses to easily collect and streamline their emissions data, measure and analyse their carbon emissions, and report on their sustainability and ESG performance.\u00a0\nRead more\nThe Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)\nPolicy & Regulations\nA comprehensive guide to the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD)\nPolicy & Regulations\nSustainability regulations in the automotive and fleet industry\nPolicy & Regulations\nThe Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)\nPolicy & Regulations\n6 key steps to ESG reporting\nPolicy & Regulations\nThe importance of ESG regulations in facilitating business climate action\nPolicy & Regulations\nGet your company on the path to net-zero\nBook a call with our sustainability experts\nGet in touch", "source": "https://plana.earth/academy/how-to-prepare-for-csrd", "metadata": {"title": "Are you ready for the CSRD?

With approximately 4-8% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions being attributed to the apparel and footwear industry there is widespread concern about the impact of the fashion industry upon climate change. Meanwhile, the extent to which the fashion industry is intertwined with human rights issues, such as fair wage payment, is increasingly being questioned.\u00a0\nThe environmental and social impact of fashion\u00a0\nUnsustainable \u2018fast-fashion\u2019 trends have further accentuated the carbon footprint of the fashion industry. The excessive consumption and short-spanned life cycle of clothing that is promoted by fast fashion sees the mass production of low-priced clothing, with the number of garments produced annually doubling since 2000. Fast fashion trends have seen the industry grow to account for a fifth of annual plastic production globally.\nMeanwhile, fast fashion accelerates the use of microplastics, energy consumption and water consumption, thus accentuating non-renewable resource dependence and climate change. Polyester - a ubiquitous form of plastic that is derived from oil - has overtaken cotton as the backbone of textile production. Garments made from polyester and other synthetic fibres are a prime source of microplastic pollution, which is especially harmful to marine life.\nFinally, the environmental risks of fast-fashion and its contribution to climate change is underlined with projections showing the production of fossil fuel-based clothing will continue to grow in the next two decades.\u00a0\nAnnual global fibre production.\nCredit: Tecnon OrbiChem\nMeanwhile, increasing social awareness around the destructive effects of fast fashion has underpinned a shift towards individuals placing a greater emphasis upon sustainability when making decisions related to fashion.\u00a0 This involves considering the environmental footprint that is associated with garments; such as ensuring textile-usage does not involve microplastics, steering away from polyester which depends on oil, ensuring garments are made to last, and the production of items does not require excessive energy or water usage. Furthermore, there have been growing considerations for social factors, such as whether fair labour practices were used within the production of garments. The growing focus upon sustainability in the fashion industry can be exemplified through Zara, who committed to ensuring that 50% of items it sells in 2022 will be made with recycled materials and \u201cecologically grown cotton\u201d.\u00a0\nHowever, fast fashion remains a prominent trend within the consumer market, causing widespread environmental destruction. This ultimately raises the question of:\n- What regulations will be actioned to shape a low-carbon fashion economy?\n- What will such regulations mean for fashion businesses around the globe?\nWhich policies and regulations are set to influence the fashion industry?\nThe inevitable acceleration of climate change and environmental damage associated with unsustainable fashion necessitates the implementation of policies and regulations that pave the way towards a more sustainable fashion industry. Meanwhile, ensuring that the fashion industry is socially responsible requires laws which ensure workers are not subject to exploitation. As such, there are several new laws that have been proposed on a global-scale in response to increased attention surrounding ESG and fashion.\u00a0\nWithin the European Union (EU)\nEU Strategy for Sustainable and Circular Textiles: Overview of proposed policies.\nCredit: Plan A\n- Extended Producer Responsibility on Textiles: The Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) aims to reduce industry waste. The regulations also aim to hold brands accountable for the environmental impact of their items. \u200d\n- Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive: The Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) ensures that environmental and human rights due diligence is enacted across the whole supply chain of businesses. \u200d\n- Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive: The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) mandates that businesses of all sizes report their environmental and social activities, which are then subject to audits.\u00a0\u200d\n- Eco-Design for Sustainable Products Regulation: The Eco-Design for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR) aims to maximise sustainability through a focus upon the areas of resource use, repairs and circularity. This regulation mandates a \u2018Product Passport\u2019 being included with items to ensure consumers are able to make informed decisions.\u00a0\nA timeline of the EU's sustainability policies affecting the fashion sector.\nCredit:\u00a0Bloomberg\nSuch actioned and proposed regulations within the EU inevitably mean that greenwashing will no longer be an option for fashion businesses. The EU\u2019s holistic strategy will transform the way in which clothing is produced, distributed and disposed; thus paving the way to a circular, and more sustainable fashion industry.\u00a0\nWithin the United States (US):\nWithin the United States there have been ESG regulations recently introduced that further aim to shape a more sustainable fashion industry.\n- Fashion Sustainability and Social Accountability Act: This proposed legislation focuses upon larger companies and mandates that fashion companies map their supply chains, whilst addressing the broader environmental and social impacts of their operations.\u00a0\u200d\n- Fashioning Accountability and Building Real Institutional Change Act (FABRIC Act): The FABRIC Act is federal legislation that focuses upon protecting workers within the US textiles and fashion industry through fair working conditions, fair pay and safe working conditions.\n- \u200d Garment Worker Protection Act: The Garment Worker Protection Act is a landmark step towards ending worker exploitation and ensuring fair pay within the fashion industry. The act works to incentivise brands through legal liability to tackle workplace violations, and also eliminate the by-the-piece payment used to underpay workers\u00a0\n5 steps fashion businesses must take to ensure compliance with sustainability regulations\nThe resource-intensive and wasteful nature of the textile sector ultimately makes it one of the least sustainable industries globally. With the production of textiles doubling between 2000 and 2015 - and expected to double by 2030 - the introduction of such legislation is critical to provoking a genuine shift away from fast fashion trends, and paving a more sustainable fashion industry.\u00a0 Whilst these laws will definitely aid in the industry\u2019s transition towards sustainability, fashion-oriented businesses must take it upon themselves to re-shape, or improve, their current business models through implementing sustainable policies and practices.\u00a0\nIn order for fashion businesses to mitigate the detrimental effects of climate change, bolster their ESG performance to meet growing regulatory requirements - they must:\n1. Utilise sustainability software\nLeveraging the vast opportunities and benefits associated with sustainability software . Plan A\u2019s comprehensive sustainability solutions platform takes a holistic approach to ensure businesses within the fashion industry can mitigate the non-financial and financial risks that will inevitably increase with forthcoming policy implementation, with studies showing that high to severe ESG incidents lead to a 6% loss of market capitalisation on average. Furthermore, sustainability software can improve ESG performance to ensure businesses within the fashion sector can harness the long-term benefits of sustainability.\n2. Map out the supply chain\nSupply chain analysis allows businesses within the fashion industry to identify any risks or opportunities related to sustainability and ESG; such as incentivising key areas of the wider supply chain to utilise green energy. A highly useful component embedded within Plan A\u2019s decarbonisation software is a suppliers module, which allows businesses to map out their supply chain and identify key opportunities and risks related to sustainability.\n3. Undergo a life cycle analysis\u00a0\nA life cycle analysis (LCA) is a valuable scientific environmental impact assessment method that allows fashion businesses to measure the footprint of their products. A life cycle assessment assesses the environmental impact of a product throughout every phase of the product life-cycle. This includes analysing the environmental footprint across every stage, such as the production of raw materials, the production processes that take place at a manufacturer, the transportation of materials and of the product to consumers, the use of the product, and how a product is disposed of- or recycled.\n4. Implement more circular practices\nFollowing a life cycle analysis, fashion businesses must prioritise the implementation of circular practices - with a key focus on reusing and recycling. For instance, fashion businesses may take action to use less materials when producing individual items - thus increasing their recyclability. Fashion businesses should also focus on eliminating non-recyclable materials and pollutants from their supply chain. Lastly, fashion businesses should consider recapturing all unused material for reuse; such as garment offcuts and packaging.\n5. Utilise more sustainable packaging\nGrowing consumer awareness surrounding the detrimental environmental harm which single use plastics hold has resulted in 72% of consumers being willing to pay more for a product that is packaged in a sustainable way. Meanwhile, the European Union\u2019s ban on single-use plastic packaging means it is ever-so vital for fashion businesses to integrate sustainable packaging alternatives into their value chain. The Sustainable Packaging Coalition offers a criteria for sustainable packaging that fashion businesses should follow.\nThe fashion industry\u2019s substantial impact upon climate change, from influencing CO 2 levels to posing wider environmental threats, ultimately necessitates businesses to reshape their practices to not only reduce their carbon footprint, but also ensure compliance with new policies and regulations within the fashion sector. By following the aforementioned steps; fashion-oriented companies will ensure they are compliant with policies whilst being transparent with both internal and external stakeholders; thus enabling them to unlock long-term strategic value through sustainability.\u00a0\nTo ensure compliance with upcoming regulations, and realise the benefits of implementing sustainability within your business, book a demo with Plan A .\u00a0\nRead more\nThe Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)\nPolicy & Regulations\nA comprehensive guide to the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD)\nPolicy & Regulations\nSustainability regulations in the automotive and fleet industry\nPolicy & Regulations\nHow to prepare a sustainability budget in 2023\nCorporate Sustainability\nThe evolving responsibilities of Chief Sustainability Officers\nCorporate Sustainability\nHow the EU greenwashing regulations will impact your business\nCorporate Sustainability\nGet your company on the path to net-zero\nBook a call with our sustainability experts\nGet in touch", "source": "https://plana.earth/academy/sustainability-fashion-guide-esg-regulations", "metadata": {"title": "Sustainability in fashion: A guide to ESG regulations", "content": ["Fashion", "Regulations", "Sustainability"]}}

The automotive industry, a central player in this global narrative, finds itself uniquely positioned to make a significant contribution to achieving net-zero carbon emissions and thus benefiting all stakeholders of climate change . As the demands for vehicle production and advanced mobility escalate in line with growing populations and industrialisation, sustainable solutions and regulations are more crucial than ever.\nIncreasing populations, industrialisation, and a requirement for advanced mobility has created an immense demand for wide-scale vehicle production and reliance. Accordingly, one key sector which stands as a central lever for change within the global journey towards net-zero is the automotive and fleet industry. Upcoming sustainability regulations will undoubtedly challenge, yet concurrently offer opportunities to the industry, catalysing innovation and steering the move towards a cleaner, greener future. This underscores the central role of the automotive industry in the global journey towards environmental sustainability and its impending impacts on their operational landscape.\nAs such, this article will examine the impact of the global automotive and fleet industry upon global greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), the sustainability and ESG regulations impacting this industry, and how businesses within this sector can adapt to and leverage such regulations to reap the long-term benefits of sustainability.\u00a0\nThe carbon footprint of the global automotive and fleet industry\nThe carbon-intensive nature of the automotive and fleet industry demands a transition towards sustainability immediately. Transportation accounts for approximately 23% of the energy-related\u00a0 CO\u2082 emissions around the globe , whilst road transport accounts for 72% of all EU domestic and international transport GHG emissions. Meanwhile, tailpipe emissions from road vehicles account for almost 75% of carbon emissions within the mobility sector. This equates to around 6gt of CO\u2082 per annum and around 15% of global CO\u2082 emissions.\n\u200d\nAn increasing population has driven the expansion of domestic transport, and thus the carbon emissions within this sector. Credit: European Environment Agency\nSuch an immense contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) places the automotive and fleet industry as a vital lever for change within global efforts towards net-zero targets. Meanwhile, shifting consumer values and increasing regulations means companies within this sector will ultimately be required to replace fossil-fuel dependent vehicles with low-carbon alternatives, such as electric vehicles (EVs) or hydrogen fuel-cell operated vehicles. Meanwhile, whilst reducing the volume of emissions caused by the fuel combustion of a vehicle\u2019s engine is paramount to global decarbonisation efforts, manufacturers and companies\u00a0 must make sustainability a priority within every aspect of their supply chain through taking action to reduce the scope 3 emissions . In doing so, companies will ensure that sustainability is at the forefront of their long-term strategy.\u00a0\nTransport emissions in the European Union. Credit: European Environment Agency\nClimate regulations within the automotive and fleet sector\nOn a global scale, governments and regulatory bodies are introducing policies which aim to pave the way to a low-carbon automotive and fleet sector. Meanwhile, within the European Union, targets to reduce road transport emissions have been introduced alongside a range of policies aimed at reducing fossil fuel usage within the automotive industry.\u00a0\n\u200d CO\u2082 targets and fuel bans\n- The EU\u2019s new CO\u2082 targets which aim to reduce road transport emissions, through cutting harmful emissions from new passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, incorporates Intermediate emissions reduction targets of 55% for cars and 50% for vans by 2030. An agreement on such targets was reached in October 2023 , and it was approved by parliament in February 2023. Furthermore, In June 2022 , the European Commission announced a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2035; thus further confirming that the automotive and fleet sector will inevitably be forced to undergo green transition.\u00a0\nEmissions Trading System (ETS)\n- The EU has proposed various other measures to complement such CO\u2082 targets, including: a new emissions trading system (ETS) for road transport and buildings, an increased share of renewable transport fuels, the removal of tax advantages for fossil fuels, and a revision of the alternative fuels infrastructure legislation to expand capacity.\nCorporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)\n- The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) , which comes into play within the 2024 FY,\u00a0 is the new EU legislation requiring all large companies to publish regular reports on their environmental and social impact activities. It helps investors, consumers, policymakers, and other stakeholders evaluate large companies' non-financial performance. Thus, it encourages these companies to develop more responsible approaches to business. The CSRD poses significant requirements to larger-scale companies in the automotive and fleet industry. Therefore, automotive and fleet companies who have not yet established clear and meaningful sustainability metrics and KPIs need to act immediately.\nSuch proposals aim to significantly reduce carbon emissions within the wider road transport sector, where GHG emissions have increased by 21% since 1990. In doing so, the EU aims to achieve ambitious climate goals, such as zero emissions on European roads by 2035, along with the European climate goal which makes the goal of reducing EU emissions by at least 55% by 2030 a legal obligation. Mandating that the automotive and fleet industry shift towards zero-carbon vehicles will not only ensure better air quality; but will provide a range of benefits to businesses within the sector, such as greater energy efficiency and cost savings .\u00a0\nIncreasing regulations and changing consumer values is seeing petrol and diesel vehicles being phased out. Credit: ACEA\nFive steps towards sustainability within the automotive and fleet industry\u00a0\nBusinesses within the automotive and fleet industry must place sustainability at the forefront of their strategy to ensure they can adapt to, and leverage, forthcoming regulations. Companies take the lead on such a vital topic, through developing and implementing a sustainability strategy which incorporates phasing out carbon-intensive vehicles, monitoring and reporting on their carbon emissions, and actively taking steps to enact decarbonisation across their wider supply chain will not only mitigate compliance risk, but also ensure they align with increasingly sustainable consumer values. As such, businesses should use the following steps as a guide.\n- Understand the regulatory environment and the relevance of certain policies: In light of increasing regulations within the automotive and fleet industry across the EU, and worldwide, it is vital that organisations gain an understanding of the general and industry-specific policies which are relevant to the organisation both now, and in the future. Visit Plan A\u2019s policy centre to learn more. \u200d\n- Make sustainability a strategic priority: Sustainability must become a central focus of the organisation\u2019s long-term value-proposition and strategy. Increasingly sustainable values, with sustainable product sales growing four times more than conventional product growth since 2014, means that sustainability will continue to be a strategic priority for pioneering businesses within the automotive and fleet industry. Furthermore, increasing regulations means that greenwashing inevitably no longer being an option for companies, thus mandating that companies who wish to remain competitive undergo sustainable transition immediately. \u200d\n- Embed sustainability leadership within organisations: Ensuring that sustainability-focused leadership is embedded within the organisational structure of a company, such as a Chief Sustainability Officer who reports directly to the CEO - is essential to developing and implementing an organisation-wide sustainability strategy, whilst also aligning all departments to ensure ESG requirements are met.\u00a0\u200d\n- Collect data and monitor emissions: Companies within the automotive and fleet industry must start collecting data immediately so that their Scope 1,2 and 3 emissions from their wider supply chain can be accurately monitored, and thus reduced. This is vital to sustainability transitioning, whilst also avoiding vast expenses associated with not following ESG requirements. Plan A offers a comprehensive platform for data collection, carbon accounting, monitoring, reporting and reduction. \u200d\n- Leverage existing and future technologies: Utilising existing and future technologies to assist within the monitoring and reduction of carbon emissions; particularly within carbon-intensive sectors such as the automotive and fleet industry. Sustainability software is a great first step for any business looking to bolster their stance on sustainability software .\u00a0\nAs the global economy undergoes green transition, businesses within the automotive and fleet industry will ultimately be required to become sustainable if they wish to ascertain a competitive advantage. Therefore, it is highly recommended that automotive and fleet oriented businesses utilise\u00a0 a comprehensive carbon accounting and decarbonisation platform to easily collect and streamline emissions data, measure and analyse carbon emissions across scopes 1,2 and 3, and report on sustainability and ESG performance.\nStay ahead of the curve and reap the long-term benefits of sustainability.

Experts have warned us for decades that inaction will lead to drastic hunger levels , mass migration due to flooding, the collapse of financial markets and many more socio-economic disasters. If businesses were anxious about COVID-19, climate change will give them goosebumps. That is why leaders and executives are now increasing their attention to sustainability, and reviewing their mission and purpose. Sustainability is a business imperative, and should not be considered as a mere component of corporate social responsibility.\nBusinesses must reduce their environmental impact. One of the most significant ways to do this is by reducing their carbon footprint, and this starts with monitoring carbon emissions. Our comprehensive guide explains emission scopes 1, 2 & 3 (as defined by the GHG Protocol), and how Plan A helps companies become carbon neutral.\nScope 1 2 3 emissions credit: Dmitry Makeev\nReducing carbon emissions is a business imperative\nRecent announcements from GAFA and other major companies show how significant carbon footprints have become for businesses. Apple, for example, has committed to making its supply chain carbon-neutral by 2030 . Nine other huge companies (inc. Starbucks, Microsoft, Unilever, Nike) are founders of Transform to Net Zero , with the mission to accelerate the transition to a net-zero carbon economy .\nThe fact is, carbon emissions are responsible for 81% of overall GHG emissions , and businesses are responsible for a lot of it. The rest of GHG emissions are: methane (10%), nitrous oxide (7%) and fluorinated gases (3%). Businesses must monitor and report their CO 2 emissions, which is the key first step in reducing them. To do so, companies must classify their carbon footprint in three scopes . \"Companies that persist in treating climate change solely as a corporate social responsibility issue, rather than a business problem, will risk the greatest consequences.\"\nMichael E. Porter and Forest L. Reinhardt\nExplained: Scope 1, 2 & 3 emissions\nAccording to the leading GHG Protocol corporate standard , a company's greenhouse gas emissions are classified into three scopes . Scope 1 and 2 are mandatory to report, whereas scope 3 is voluntary and the hardest to monitor. However, companies succeeding in reporting all three scopes will gain a sustainable competitive advantage .\nScheme 1,2,3 scope emissions Credit: Plan A based on GHG protocol\nScope 1: direct emissions\nScope 1 emissions are direct emissions from company-owned and controlled resources. In other words, emissions are released into the atmosphere as a direct result of a set of activities, at a firm level. It is divided into four categories: stationary combustion (e.g fuels, heating sources). All fuels that produce GHG emissions must be included in scope 1.\u00a0\nThen, mobile combustion is all vehicles owned or controlled by a firm, burning fuel (e.g. cars, vans, trucks). The increasing use of \u201celectric\u201d vehicles (EVs), means that some of the organisation fleets could fall into Scope 2 emissions.\nScope 1 emissions - Transportation\nCredit: Rodrigo Abreu\nFugitive emissions are leaks from greenhouse gases (e.g. refrigeration, air conditioning units). It is important to note that refrigerant gases are a thousand times more dangerous than CO 2 emissions. Companies are encouraged to report these emissions.\nProcess emissions are released during industrial processes, and on-site manufacturing (e.g. production of CO 2 during cement manufacturing, factory fumes, chemicals).\nScope 1 emissions Credit: Torbenbrinker\nScope 2: indirect emissions - owned\nScope 2 emissions are indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy, from a utility provider. In other words, all GHG emissions released in the atmosphere, from the consumption of purchased electricity, steam, heat and cooling .\nScope 2 emissions credit: Norbert Nagel\nFor most organisations, electricity will be the unique source of scope 2 emissions. Simply stated, the energy consumed falls into two scopes : Scope 2 covers the electricity consumed by the end-user. Scope 3 covers the energy used by the utilities during transmission and distribution (T&D losses).\nScope 3: indirect emissions - n ot owned\nRead this paragraph carefully as scope 3 emissions represent the holy grail of emissions.\u00a0\nScope 3 emissions are all indirect emissions - not included in scope 2 - that occur in the value chain of the reporting company, including both upstream and downstream emissions. In other words, emissions are linked to the company's operations. According to GHG protocol , scope 3 emissions are separated into 15 categories.\nUpstream activities\nScope 3 emissions - Travel\nCredit: Arpingstone\nUpstream activities fall under several categories: for many companies, business travel is one of the most significant to report (e.g. air travel, rail, underground and light rail, taxis, buses and business mileage using private vehicles). Also, employee commuting shall be reported, as it results from the emissions emitted through travel to and from work. It can be decreased through public transportation and home office.\u00a0\nWaste generated in operations relates to waste sent to landfills and wastewater treatments. Waste disposal emits methane (CH 4 ) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O), which cause greater damage than CO 2 emissions.\nScope 3 emissions \u00a0\u2013 Waste\nCredit: Acabashi\nPurchased goods and services , includes all the upstream ('cradle to gate') emissions from the production of goods and services purchased by the company in the same year. It is useful to differentiate between purchases of production-related products (e.g, materials, components and parts) and non-production-related products (e.g, office furniture, office supplies and IT support).\nScope 3 emissions \u2013 Office supplies\nCredit: Friedrich Haag\nTransportation and distribution occur in upstream (suppliers) and downstream (customers) elements of the value chain. It includes emissions from transportation by land, sea and air, as well as emissions relating to third-party warehousing.\nFuel and energy-related activities include emissions relating to the production of fuels and energy purchased and consumed by the reporting company, in the reporting year that is not included in scope 1 and 2.\nScope 3 emissions \u2013 Fuel Production\nCredit: Khamkeo Vilaysing\nCapital goods are final products that have an extended life and are used by the company to manufacture a product, provide a service or, store, sell and deliver merchandise. Examples of capital goods include buildings, vehicles, machinery. For purposes of accounting for scope 3 emissions, companies should not depreciate, discount, or amortize the emissions from the production of capital goods over time. Instead, companies should account for the total cradle-to-gate emissions of purchased capital goods in the year of acquisition (GHG protocol).\nDownstream activities\nScope 3 emissions - Investments\nCredit: Sharon Mccutcheon\nInvestments are included largely for financial institutions, but other organisations can still integrate it into their reporting. According to GHG accounting, investments fall under 4 categories: equity investments, debt investments, project finance, managed investments and client services.\nFranchises are businesses operating under a licence to sell or distribute another company\u2019s goods or services within a certain location. Franchisees (e.g. companies that operate franchises and pay a fee to the franchisor) should include emissions, from operations under their control. \u201cFranchisees may optionally report upstream scope 3 emissions associated with the franchisor\u2019s operations (i.e., the scope 1 and scope 2 emissions of the franchisor) in category 1 (Purchased goods and services).\"\nScope 3 emissions \u2013 Franchises\nCredit: Gillfoto\nLeased assets correspond to leased assets by the reporting organisation (upstream) and assets to other organisations (downstream). The calculation method is complex and shall be reported in scope 1 or 2, depending on the nature of the leased asset.\u00a0\nUsed of sold products is included, concerning \"in-use\" products that are sold to the consumers. It measures the emissions resulting from product usage, even if it varies considerably. For example, the use of an iPhone will take many years to equal the emissions emitted during production.\nAt the same time, \" end of life treatment \" corresponds to products sold to consumers, and is reported similarly as \"waste generated during operations\". Companies must assess how their products are disposed of, which can be difficult as it usually depends on the consumer.

For decades, companies have missed significant opportunities for improvement . For example, Kraft Foods reported that 90% of its total emissions, fell under its value chain (cf. scope 3). Finally, companies must conduct a full GHG emission inventory - scope 1, 2 and 3 - to focus their efforts on reducing carbon emissions, carbon footprint and becoming carbon-neutral.\nReporting and reducing carbon emissions is time-consuming, challenging and deserves close expertise.

A burning concept to understand. Be prepared for it to burst.\nClimate Science\nFinance\nfossil fuels\nJune 29, 2022\nTara Bernoville\nThe carbon bubble might cause the next financial crisis . Over our lifetime, we have experienced many crises: the internet bubble, the global financial crisis of 2008, the US house market crash, and the recent crypto market dump. If all these bubbles had adverse effects on our economy, the carbon bubble burst might send shockwaves to our entire economy.\nIn this article, we explain what risks fossil fuels pose to the financial market and how we can protect our economic system from them.\nWhat is the carbon bubble?\nThe \u201ccarbon bubble\u201d stems from an overvaluation of fossil fuel companies\u2019 oil, coal, and gas reserves. The notion of a carbon bubble is based on our knowledge that 2\u00b0C is the absolute maximum amount of temperature rise that humanity can cope with. Any more than that, and we will live on an inhabitable planet.\nThe \u201ccarbon bubble\u201d started as a warning from a niche group of climate-minded financiers in the early 2010s but has since become accepted as orthodoxy by most major regulators and financial institutions.\nLike the carbon bubble, financial bubbles occur when the price of an asset increases due to unrealistic projections of its value. Often, shareholders speculate that their investments will continue to be valuable, maintaining high stock prices and consumer confidence. Sometimes, however, demand and market conviction will be met with real-world situations that devalue the asset.\nIt is precisely the case for fossil fuel companies as the world tries to move away from these carbon-intensive energies to switch to renewables and low-carbon technologies. And, we are getting there. As evidence, two-thirds of solar and wind farms built in 2020 will provide cheaper electricity than even the most affordable coal plants \u2013 making renewables the cheapest power source today.\nThe carbon bubble and the overvaluation of fossil fuel companies\nThe carbon bubble problem arises when we consider that all fossil fuel reserves \u2013 every drop of oil and particle of atmospheric carbon \u2013 are currently included in the valuation of the companies that own them. These companies are massively overvalued unless we want to exceed our carbon budget. All companies on the stock market are evaluated on the basis that we will burn all of our reserves based on our current economic logic.\nThe overvaluation of fossil fuel companies is a real issue. Most Wall Street and valuation indexes analysts are doing their valuations based on misleading data. A recent RethinkX report points out that since 2010, $2 trillion has been invested in fossil fuels and nuclear power based on misleading assumption s about the value of these industries. The RethinkX report also found that Levelized cost of energy (LCOE) companies are overvalued by 400% , resulting in a potential market crash.\nThis carbon bubble situation is leading us to two potential outcomes. On the one hand, fossil fuel companies burn all of our reserves, clearly blowing our carbon budget and cooking up the planet beyond recognition. On the other hand, governments implement regulations to stop companies from extracting unburnable carbon, which would make these companies drastically overvalued overnight, causing the carbon bubble to burst.\nThe carbon budget\nYou might have noticed an increase in temperatures and natural disasters \u2013 and before we all become cooked beyond recognition, it is essential to limit the rise of temperatures to 2\u00b0C under the Paris Agreement.\nTo achieve the Paris Agreement goals, the world can release only a certain amount of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere (caused by burning fossil fuels, oil and gas) \u2013 the so-called carbon budget . Any more than this, and we run over budget.\nCarbon Tracker calculated the carbon budget for 2020, which was at 495GtCO2 \u2013 as of 2020, this equates to 11.5 years for a 50% probability of a 1.5\u00b0C warming outcome.\nYou get it: Our reserves must stay in the ground to keep the carbon budget. A 2021 study published in Nature proved that to have a 50% chance of staying within a 1.5\u00b0C temperature rise scenario, 60% of remaining oil and fossil methane gas reserves and 90% of coal reserves must remain unextracted by 2050. This so-called \u2018unburnable carbon\u2019 creates a fossil fuel overhang that we cannot use.\nResources that must stay untapped to remain under the 2\u00b0C limit\nWhy do carbon budgets matter to businesses?\nA carbon budget follows similar lines to a business or country\u2019s typical financial budget. They tell a business how much carbon dioxide they have left to emit to contribute to staying below a certain level of warming.\nCarbon budgets are valuable for companies to develop a decarbonisation plan. A company can set a budget against its target in alignment with the 1.5 \u00b0C and, thanks to the budget, can create visibility around the \u201clow hanging fruit\u201d and leave the rest of the budget to the more complex decarbonisation challenges.\nThe carbon bubble effect: the financial risk of the century\nSimilar to the butterfly effect, the carbon bubble effect has investors worried \u2013 and they should. Individual investors are projected to be sitting on a $763 million carbon bubble .\nThe value of stranded assets will be about $4 trillion , the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report concluded. Another report stated more optimistically that stranded oil and gas production assets would total $1.4 trillion \u2013 if we meet the Paris targets to stay below 1.5 degrees. This figure is likely underestimated as it doesn\u2019t include many ancillary assets and companies, like oil refineries and gas export terminals.\nThe carbon bubble: Potential losses from stranded oil and gas assets, by the ultimate owner\nCredit: Nature (2022)\nNot convinced yet? Take it from British investor Jeremy Grantham , who manages over $106 billion in assets, and divested all of his support from fossil fuels and coal in 2013.\nHe explains: \u201cThe probability of fossil fuel companies running into trouble is too high for me to take that risk as an investor. If we mean to burn all the coal and any appreciable percentage of the tar sands, or other unconventional oil and gas, then we\u2019re cooked. There are terrible consequences that we will lay at the door of our grandchildren.\u201d\nI did not invest in fossil fuel companies, am I concerned by the carbon bubble?\nWe hope you did not, but your pension fund or asset manager certainly has. A 2020 study found that pension funds in OECD countries could collectively manage \u20ac238\u2013828 billion in fossil fuel assets (up to $978 billion).\nIn 2021, half of the world\u2019s 29 largest asset managers did not have the policy to exclude coal as an asset. And while many asset managers have pledged to be leaving coal behind , the world\u2019s three largest asset management groups, BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, still managed over $300 billion of fossil fuel investments as recently as 2019. On the bright side, Norway, the world\u2019s largest sovereign wealth fund at $1.4 trillion, sold its stocks in fossil fuel companies in January 2021.\nThe carbon bubble all directly or indirectly impacts us. Divesting from fossil fuels is not only the right thing to do for our planet. It is the right thing to do for our economy.

This is a positive trend as decarbonisation is popularised as a legitimate way to mitigate climate and regulatory risk, increase one\u2019s competitiveness and unlock supply chain optimisation. However, as the number of net-zero press releases and news articles grows, the language around the net-zero emissions topic develops, distorts, and fades around the edges. What\u2019s more, some intentionally muddy the waters in their interest to greenwash their performance. This greenwashing is achieved through vague sustainability promises with credible-sounding, but ultimately undefined terminology to hide the unsubstantiated claims.\nTo fight the confusing language (i.e. \u201cjargon\u201d) and growing greenwashing; the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) has published a \u201c Net-Zero Jargon Buster \u201d alongside their \u201c Net-Zero Standard \u201d. As Plan A aligns with SBTi\u2019s terminology, we want to shed light on the topic by explaining the common terms , relating them to each other and the Net-Zero Journey that Plan A customers (and other companies) embark on.\nThe Net-zero journey terminology buster\nNet-Zero can be as daunting as a Scrabble game\nCredit: Greenbiz\nTo start, let's deep dive in the core of net-zero definitions and terminology:\n- Net-zero means cutting greenhouse gas emissions to as close to zero as possible, with any remaining emissions re-absorbed from the atmosphere by oceans and forests, for instance. Net-zero is reached when a business has eliminated all the carbon emissions it could and then compensated the remaining emissions with beyond value chain mitigation. The net-zero process starts with calculating emissions across Scope 1, 2, and 3, setting science-based targets, developing decarbonisation pathways until 2030, and gradually moving towards long-term carbon capture, storage, and sequestration for those emissions which cannot be reduced.\n- Carbon neutral is a theoretical state achieved via the \u201coffsetting\u201d or \u201ccompensating\u201d of residual emissions with projects beyond the company\u2019s own value chain. However, this may hide and distract from real decarbonisation, where emissions are cut within the company\u2019s operations. The Science Based Targets initiative\u2019s Net-Zero Standard clearly states: \u201cSBTi does not validate carbon neutrality claims.\u201d\n\u200d\n- Neutralisation corresponds to the removal of carbon from the atmosphere and its permanent storage. It can also be referred to as Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR). Projects include inter alia Direct Air Capture (DAC) and Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS).\n- Beyond value chain mitigation (BVCM) are measures taken to avoid (prevent), reduce or eliminate greenhouse gas emissions outside of their value chain. Both compensation and neutralisation can be considered BVCM, and should always come as an addition to decarbonisation, rather than its substitute.\n- Near-term science-based targets are defined by targets for the next five to ten years, halving emissions as compared to a baseline year. A first reality check on a company\u2019s journey to Net Zero 2050.\n- Long-term science-based targets are achieved when decarbonisation reaches over 90% as compared to baseline emissions, to achieve Net Zero by 2050, with residual targets addressed with neutralisation.\n- Mitigation Hierarchy means that decarbonisation should always come before Beyond value chain mitigation (BVCM): compensation and neutralisation. Net Zero can only be achieved by deep emission cuts of at least 90% by 2050, after which residual emissions are addressed with neutralisation.\nLearn more with our Corporate Sustainability Glossary.\nThe Net-zero journey for corporates and beyond\nA company can only become net-zero by first setting a target consistent with emission cuts (abatement) required to meet the 1.5-degree warming carbon budget. Secondly, the company needs to start dramatically reducing its emissions through decarbonisation to stay on this target. Finally, and only then, residual emissions should be neutralised via removal projects, permanently removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Traditional offsetting is not recognised as climate action by the SBTi or Plan A and is not counted towards a company\u2019s Net-Zero target. While the Net-Zero Journey is a significant multi-decade commitment, it is important to remember that alongside climate protection it brings a multitude of business co-benefits.\nFigure 1. Net-zero journey .\n*The term \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d refers to the point where a company has compensated, a.k. \u201coffset\u201d their residual emissions via Carbon Avoidance Projects. However, this may hide and distract from the real need for genuine deep decarbonisation. \u201c--SBTi does not validate carbon neutrality claims.\u201d\nCredit: Plan A\n\u200d\nHow to become net-zero?\nLet\u2019s examine the Net-Zero Journey of a hypothetical company, called \u201cDunder Mifflin\u201d, via the Net-Zero graph above.\nDunder Mifflin claims to be \u201cCarbon Neutral\u201d today by having \u201ccompensated\u201d or \u201coffset\u201d their emissions via carbon avoidance projects or other carbon credits. Although voluntary carbon markets have generated capital for some promising projects , many studies have shown problems with i.a. permanence, overestimation and additionnality , even when the credits are \u2018verified\u2019. More importantly, offsetting is likely to hide and distract from the real need for genuine deep decarbonisation. The SBTi clearly states: \u201c -- SBTi does not validate carbon neutrality claims . \u201d. Therefore, offsetting does not contribute towards Science Based Targets (SBTs), decarbonisation, or the Net-Zero goal.\u00a0\nLet's assume that the company \"Dunder Mifflin's\" Business-As-Usual (BAU) emissions, shown in orange in the graph above, denote their increasing emissions if no decarbonisation action is taken. The \u201cdecarbonisation within value chain\u201d arrow shows the number of emissions that can be, and should be, addressed via i.a. changes in energy supply (electrification), materials substitution, process optimisation, and employee engagement. This year-on-year abatement results in lowered \u201cresidual emissions\u201d, i.e. the emissions post-decarbonisation that remain between status quo and Net-Zero. The gap towards Net-Zero can be further closed by \u201cneutralisation\u201d however. Dunder Mifflin \u201cNet emissions\u201d (the dashed line) are their residual emissions minus purchased neutralisation credits via carbon removal projects.\nNote: neutralisation does not count towards the \u201cSBTi target\u201d in 2030 (e.g. -42%; a decarbonisation goal).\nHowever, Net-Zero itself can be achieved by neutralisation. Achieving Net-Zero without carbon dioxide removal is extremely difficult as some GHG emissions from human activity will always exist. Both compensation and neutralisation are considered \u201cmitigation beyond the value chain\u201d as these actions take place outside of the company\u2019s value chain (in some cases also within; e.g. with forestry companies).\nThe 2030 \u201cnear-term science-based target\u201d for decarbonisation should be the first reality check on a company\u2019s journey to Net-Zero in 2050. Emissions should be approximately halved at this stage (e.g. -42%) to remain on track to achieve >90% cuts in emissions and the \u201clong-term science-based target\u201d: Net-Zero emissions and contribute to the effort to achieve global <1.5-degrees warming.\u00a0\nThe corporate net-zero journey: Making sure your net-zero pledges are credible\nTrue global climate action and preventing warming greater than 1.5 degrees requires a shared understanding of the problem, the terminology defining it, and a strict approach against greenwashing. The net-zero journey is a multi-decade commitment, shedding light into the entire operations of a company, bringing several co-benefits alongside climate protection: optimised supply chains, and control over regulatory and direct climate risk. Net-Zero can be best achieved by following a clear pathway, e.g. SBTi Net-Zero Standard\u2019s \u201cMitigation Hierarchy\u201d.\n- Decarbonisation should always precede neutralisation or compensation, or in other words: \u201cwithin value chain mitigation\u201d should precede \u201cbeyond value chain mitigation\u201d.\n- Neutralisation should come before compensation. Net-Zero can only be achieved by deep emission cuts of at least 90% by 2050, after which residual emissions are to be addressed with neutralisation.\nBacked with these rules and best practices, the combined efforts of Corporate Net-Zero Journeys can lead the charge for global climate action and the 1.5-degree target.\nTake ownership of your net-zero journey with Plan A.

This is the question.\nClimate Science\nnet zero emissions\nDecarbonisation\nJune 22, 2023\nTara Bernoville\nUnderstanding the meaning of net-zero emissions is crucial as they stand at the forefront of our sustainability agenda. The latest climate science reinforces that to limit global warming to under 1.5\u00b0C, the world needs to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.\nThe net-zero transition will accelerate this year and for the decades to come. Over 130 countries have already set a target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2050. However, after numerous international summits like COP, it is unlikely that current pledges will limit climate change under the 1.5\u00b0C scenario to avoid its worst impacts. Global GHG emissions must be halved by\u00a045% from 2010 levels by 2030 (with methane needing to be reduced by a third) .\u00a0\nNavigating the jargon around net-zero emissions can be daunting: What exactly is the meaning of net-zero emissions , and how to achieve net-zero emissions ?\nWhat are net-zero emissions?\u00a0\u00a0\nBy definition , net-zero emissions means cutting greenhouse gas emissions to as close to zero as possible , with any remaining emissions re-absorbed from the atmosphere by oceans and forests, for instance. Net-zero is reached when a business has eliminated all the carbon emissions it could and then compensated the remaining emissions with beyond value chain mitigation.\nThe net-zero process starts with calculating emissions across scope 1, 2, and 3, setting science-based targets, developing decarbonisation pathways until 2030, and gradually moving towards long-term carbon capture, storage, and sequestration for those emissions which cannot be reduced.\nFor further scientific clarity, according to the IPCC , net-zero emissions are achieved when\u00a0anthropogenic removals balance anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere\u00a0over a specified period . Where multiple greenhouse gases are involved, the quantification of net-zero emissions depends on the climate metric chosen to compare emissions of different gases (such as global warming potential, global temperature change potential, and others) and the time horizon selected.\nAchieving net-zero emissions by 2050: The path ahead\nTo achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 , we need immediate and impactful climate action. As we near the critical threshold of 1.5\u00b0C increase in global temperature, the focus is now on governments and businesses to lead the charge in realising how to achieve net-zero emissions .\nA variety of strategies exist for companies to adopt science-based targets to reduce emissions and progress towards net-zero. However, it's crucial that these pledges be put into action effectively, and not merely serve as greenwashing.\n\u200d Did you know? Stabilisation of global temperatures will only occur once we've successfully achieved net-zero CO 2 emissions. To put this in perspective, limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C (2.7\u00b0F) necessitates reaching global net-zero carbon emissions by the early 2050s . Conversely, if we aim to limit the temperature increase to 2\u00b0C (3.6\u00b0F), the timeline extends to the early 2070s for reaching global net-zero carbon emissions.\nWhen will we reach net-zero emissions? A global timeline to achieve the ultimate goal.\nSource: World Resources Institute\nHow to become net-zero?\nThe United Nations launched the \"race to net-zero\" campaign with a worldwide coalition of companies and actors to answer this pressing challenge. Collectively these 3,000 actors cover\u00a0nearly 25% of global CO 2 emissions and over 50% of the worldwide GDP .\u00a0\nOn the one hand, a McKinsey report estimated that the annual cost of getting to net-zero - when CO 2 emissions are entirely reduced or captured -\u00a0will be \u20ac8.2tn ($9.2tn). On the other hand, the number of companies using science-based targets (SBTs) has significantly increased. More than 1,045 companies representing \u20ac20.5 trillion\u00a0in market capitalisation (more than the GDP of the United States) are committed to\u00a0science-based targets\u00a0for emissions reduction. Companies that translate climate commitments into concrete actions will achieve a sustainable leading status.\u00a0You don't need to climb Everest, but rather pick a hill and go. Companies often mistake the sustainability journey for an utterly complex one. It is a lot simpler. You must take the first step and start implementing actions leading to a significant shift in positioning as a market leader.\nLubomila Jordanova , CEO & Co-Founder at Plan A\nWhat about net-zero pledges?\nThe net-zero pledges model presents limitations. It is criticised that most companies setting science-based targets to reach net-zero emissions look good on paper but less in practice. This practice enables a particular \" net-zero greenwashing \", misleading well-intentioned investors, stakeholders and consumers.\nThe reason is that many businesses are still making decisions based on outdated data and often do not know which framework to refer to. Also, it is primordial for companies to include\u00a0all scope of carbon emissions in data disclosure . A\u00a0recent report\u00a0analysed the net-zero pledges of 55 of the biggest US companies and found no single large corporation with a net-zero goal covering Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions while limiting carbon offsets. The vast majority of major corporations are falling short regarding all three metrics: disclosures, targets, and actual performance.\u00a0\nChevron is one of many bad students when monitoring scope 3 emissions.\nCredit: Luis Ramirez\nFor example, Walmart, the world's largest retailer, has an official strategy to reach\u00a0zero emissions by 2040 . Yet, according to the company, its reduction plan excludes Scope 3 emissions\u2014although they make up 95% of its emissions. Take Chevron (which received an overall F grade): scope 3 emissions account for 91% of the company's greenhouse gas emissions , so while Chevron has focused on reducing Scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with 1.5 degrees, the report notes, those reductions represent only about 9% of the company's total emissions.\nExample of a net-zero company\nAmong the many companies aiming to be net-zero, Microsoft stands as a paragon. The tech giant pledged to be carbon negative by 2030, meaning it plans to remove more carbon from the atmosphere than it emits. Further, by 2050, Microsoft aims to have removed all the carbon it has emitted since its inception in 1975. Its ambitious commitment is an excellent example of a comprehensive approach to achieving net-zero emissions.\nMicrosoft\u2019s strategy revolves around the principles of reduction, electrification, and carbon capture. It uses a combination of measures like increasing the energy efficiency of their operations, transitioning to renewable energy, and leveraging carbon capture and storage technologies. Moreover, Microsoft is investing $1 billion in a new Climate Innovation Fund for technology development and carbon removal solutions. This exemplifies the transformative corporate action required to achieve the global net-zero target.\nHow can companies achieve net-zero aligned carbon compensation?\nAs part of their net-zero strategies, companies are relying on voluntary carbon offsetting, but it is unlikely to deliver on net-zero promises. According to the Science-based Target Initiative (SBTi), SMEs and PMEs need to reduce their carbon emissions by 80% before compensating anything - carbon compensation would be too easy otherwise.\nHow will you reduce your carbon emissions?\nCredit: Jasmine Sessler\nThe Oxford principles for net-zero aligned carbon offsetting\nWhile striving for net-zero emissions, it's important to scrutinise the breadth of corporate pledges and to ensure carbon offsetting aligns with net-zero goals. Also, there is a clear need for the development of net-zero aligned carbon compensation principles.\nOn this regard, the prestigious Oxford University came up with principles, better known as \" the Oxford Principles for net-zero aligned carbon offsetting \". Our decarbonisation team has recommended reading their report as it is a natural source of truth regarding carbon compensation, in line with net-zero targets.\u00a0\u00a0\nPrinciple #1: Cut your emissions first, use high-quality offsets and regularly review your compensation strategy\u00a0\nNumerous effective carbon offsetting methods have been established in recent years. Those who abide by these principles must first take into account these effective practices, which include:\n- Making your own emissions reduction a priority - The primary goal should be to limit the necessity for offsets.\n- Upholding environmental integrity - Opt for offsets that can be verified, accurately accounted for, and carry minimal risk of non-additionality, reversal, or causing unintentional adverse effects on people and the environment.\n- Sustaining transparency - Report current emissions, accounting methodologies, net-zero objectives, and the kinds of offsets being used.\nPrinciple #2: Shift to carbon removal compensation\nMost offsets available today are emission reductions necessary but not sufficient to achieve net-zero emissions in the long run. Carbon removals scrub carbon directly from the atmosphere. Users of offsets should increase the portion of their compensation that comes from carbon removals, rather than from emission reductions, ultimately reaching 100% carbon removals by midcentury to ensure compatibility with the Paris Agreement goals. Creating demand for carbon removal offsets today will send the necessary market signal to increase the supply.\u00a0\nPrinciple #3: Shift to long-live carbon storage\nThe transition from emissions reduction to carbon removal has been outlined but does not resolve how long the carbon is stored. Long-lived storage refers to storing carbon that has a low risk of reversal over centuries to millennia, such as storing CO 2 in geological reservoirs or mineralising carbon into stable forms. On the other hand, short-lived storage involves methods with a higher risk of being reversed over decades.\u00a0\nPrinciple #4: Support the development of net-zero aligned carbon compensation\nForming sector-specific alliances - work collaboratively with peers to develop a net-zero aligned offsets market. Adopting and publicising these principles and incorporating them into regulation and standard setting for carbon compensation and net-zero emissions approaches.

Companies resistant to meaningful transformation have derailed and delayed climate action through \" targeted lobbying and doubt-inducing media strategies .\" The fossil fuel sector is misleading using media campaigns to cast doubt on the science of climate change itself.\nGreenwashing and its consequences\nAdvertising agencies skilfully craft the misleading messages of these companies into slick and compelling advertising campaigns. The ads are often so convincing that they persuade even well-intentioned and informed consumers into believing climate misinformation.\u00a0\"Advertising must change at the speed of climate change because creativity isn't neutral.\" Forbes Magazine\nAdvertising must change at the speed of climate change because creativity isn't neutral.\nCredit: Plan A\nThe historical and current context of greenwashing\nFossil fuel corporations like Exxon, BP and Shell spend more money on advertising to greenwash their products than on real sustainability and decarbonisation efforts . Greenwashing and climate misinformation are misleading consumers, creating a false sense of security around corporate climate responsibility, and distracting from the real work of decarbonising our economy. In a time of planetary crisis, greenwashing is irresponsible, unethical, and downright dangerous .\nDid you know that BP was the first company to coin \"carbon footprint\" with its advertising campaign?\nCredit: Plan A\nUsing advertising to spread climate disinformation is nothing new . The fossil fuel sector has been using marketing to sow confusion and inaction since they realised, back in the 1970s, that the burning of ancient carbon was irrevocably warming the planet. The tactics have changed, but the outcome is the same: delaying the transition to green and renewable energy.\u00a0\nThe forgotten oil ads that told us climate change was nothing.\nCredit: The Guardian\nAdvertisers have been complicit in the wrecking of our climate . From denying the crisis, to scare-mongering about the economic consequences of moving away from fossil fuels, to placing the blame on consumers (BP first coined the term carbon footprint), the campaigns have been relentless and successful in delaying action. If one looks at the ad campaigns of fossil fuel companies today, it would seem they are leading the transition to green energy when nothing could be further from the truth. It is the same bag of tricks they have been using since the 1970s, with a contemporary greenwashing gloss.\nLeveraging advertising for climate advocacy\nBut what if creatives at the top advertising agencies used their powers of persuasion for good? What role could advertising then play in advancing climate solutions? While \"advertising defends the destructive oil and gas industry, greenwashes brands and drives consumption, its creativity and storytelling could change the course of climate change.\"\u00a0\nThe power of climate-focused advertising\nA recent study by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication found that targeted advertising managed to shift republican views on climate change. This power of persuasion has tremendous implications for elections and policy action:\n\u201c New Climate Voices [was] a campaign designed to convince Republicans that climate change is happening, human-caused, and harmful\u2026 The advertisements featured messengers and content that were expected to be effective with this audience. In one video, Dr. Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist and evangelical Christian, speaks about the connection between her Christian faith and climate change. In another video, Air Force General Ron Keys explains that climate change poses a national security threat and creates challenges for the U.S. military. In another, former U.S. Congressman Bob Inglis (R\u2013SC) describes how his conservative values inspire his drive for climate action. The campaign had large positive effects on the climate change beliefs and attitudes of Republicans in the two congressional districts.\u201d\nThe role of culture and storytelling in climate action\nAdvertisers can also pull the levers for change by banning fossil fuel companies from their client rosters. It is not unprecedented for the advertising industry to take an ethical stance. For instance, marketing for the tobacco industry is no longer prestigious; most firms won't touch them with a 10-foot pole. If the advertising industry shunned climate-wrecking clients like it has cigarette companies , it would be a huge win for the future of our planet. But advertisers can go beyond reducing harm.\u00a0\nAs Favianna Rodrigues writes in her essay \"Harnessing Cultural Power'' in the All We Can Save anthology, \"culture is in a constant battle for our imagination. It is our most powerful tool to inspire the social change these times demand.\" The climate crisis requires storytellers to guide us to a new future and move the collective imagination towards a fossil-free future. Advertising agencies are powerful storytellers with global reach. The impact could be extraordinary if agencies decide to stop peddling climate inaction. Marketing has not only the power to shun the fossil fuel agency and make greenwashing taboo, it can also shift the cultural zeitgeist.\nWhat will you tell your kids about climate change?\nCredit: Plan A\nStories are powerful, and the ones we tell today will create the world we live in tomorrow. In many ways, today's advertising and creative agencies are contemporary storytellers, and we need them on the side of climate action. There is a small but growing movement within the advertising community to push back against fossil fuel advertising, greenwashing and climate misinformation. Recently, advertising professional Gustav Martner returned his Cannes Lion award in protest, saying he would retrieve it once advertising instituted a fossil fuels ban.\u00a0\nMartner is not alone, and the creative industry is starting to organise itself. For instance, Clean Creatives is \"a global network of creative professionals with a shared mission to use our power, platform and influence to drive action and awareness on the climate and ecological emergency.\"\u00a0Clean Creatives urges creatives not to cross the line and refuse to work for climate-wrecking clients .\u00a0\nThe future of advertising in a climate-just world\nThe advertising industry must pick a side. Science demands we take drastic climate action, and new regulations will make greenwashing harder to pull off without penalty. If a company's sustainability plans involve smoke and mirrors, they will become uncompetitive, penalised, and irrelevant. On the other hand, companies that meaningfully adapt and implement decarbonisation will become increasingly competitive.\u00a0\nWith pressure from activists, consumers, the creative industry, and increasingly strict policy regulations, the time is ripe for the advertising industry to say no to greenwashing and fossil fuel ads and commit to a climate-just future. And there is so much work to be done. A whole new story about our future is yet to be written.\u00a0\nIf your business wants to be a driver of positive change, book a demo with Plan A today and let us build a fossil-free world, together.\u00a0\nRead more\nBilan Carbone: Your complete guide\nCorporate Sustainability\nDecarbonisation strategy: The comprehensive guide for 2024\nCorporate Sustainability\nDecarbonisation strategy for SMEs: Top 10 low-hanging fruits for immediate impact\nCorporate Sustainability\n10 Principles to End Greenwashing\nCorporate Sustainability\nHow to spot greenwashing\nCorporate Sustainability\nHow the EU greenwashing regulations will impact your business\nCorporate Sustainability\nGet your company on the path to net-zero\nBook a call with our sustainability experts\nGet in touch\n\u200d", "source": "https://plana.earth/academy/beyond-greenwashing-advertising-climate-change", "metadata": {"title": "Beyond Greenwashing: Using advertising in the fight against climate change", "content": ["greenwashing", "advertising", "climate change"]}}

Accordingly, this article provides a guide for CSOs to ensure they are meeting their responsibilities across the realms of environment, social and governance ( ESG ) and undertaking genuine action against the most pressing issue of our time; climate change.\nWhat is a Chief Sustainability Officer?\nA Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) is primarily responsible for overseeing the environmental impact of a company or organisation. In doing so, they are in charge of assessing the current and future impact assessment of a company or organisation. Meanwhile, they must ensure that government policies and regulations are abided by within all aspects of their business operations.\nCSOs ask vital questions such as:\n- How can we implement a sustainability strategy across all business departments to create long-term value?\n- How can we make a positive impact without reducing profit?\n- How will resources be allocated within the transition towards net-zero?\nUtilising a circular economy-oriented approach to thinking as such will therefore help reduce waste and pollution, circulate products and materials, and regenerating substances. Meanwhile, CSOs have a vital responsibility to ensure the company or organisation is not intended, or unintentionally, engaging in practices that reflect elements of greenwashing .\nHow leadership will influence your sustainability agenda\nThe various leadership titles within sustainability management.\nSource: Gartner\nThere are various ways in which an ESG programme can be structured, and the development of an ESG framework often sees the allocation of various positions and titles which work in different capacities depending upon a company\u2019s organisational structure. However, to enact a structure that effectively informs decisions and builds accountability within management, a cross-functional approach which seeks to align all components of a business is vital.\nHaving an ESG and sustainability management strategy in place does not necessarily mean a company requires a CSO. However, for a company or organisation to ensure that sustainability is at the core of their business, the development, implementation and management of an ESG strategy by a CSO are highly recommended. Since ESG is becoming such a central focus of businesses and organisations, it is increasingly rare not to have someone in charge of these issues. Furthermore, sustainability leaders' reporting lines significantly reflect the extent to which an organisation prioritises ESG as a strategic imperative. Sustainability officers who report directly to the CEO are viewed as playing a key role in decision-making. Meanwhile, those who report solely to finance may be seen to put an unbalanced premium on what investors want.\nWhilst there is no \u2018secret formula\u2019 for an ESG strategy; the leadership structure utilised is a paramount factor as it dictates reporting lines, cross-functional management and partnerships, thus reflecting how executive leaders value ESG progress. To ascertain which leadership structure best suits a company or organisation, the general counsel or executive must assess the following questions with the organisation's purpose and mission;\n- Does sustainability play a central role in the company or organisation's corporate strategy? If yes, how will oversight and accountability be effectively implemented?\n- If an individual is to be tasked with overseeing this, does the leader have the capacity to take ownership and oversee this portfolio?\n- What does the future look like for the company or organisation?\n- What kind of leaders are required to get there?\n- How are the company\u2019s competitors structuring the management and oversight of ESG and sustainability issues?\nAs such, different organisations require different types of sustainability leaders. Whether a firm requires a CSO or not, and the type of CSO they require, ties back to the company's internal and external assessment of what role sustainability plays now and in the future.\nThe 10 responsibilities of a Chief Sustainability Officer:\n- Regulatory awareness & compliance\n- CSOs must analyse the current regulations which apply to their activities, whilst also preparing for the implications of future regulatory trends.\n- In doing so, CSOs must ensure that their business or organisation is compliant with current laws and regulations surrounding sustainability; with a key focus on the specific regulations that apply to their respective industry, business type, and processes.\n- Moreover, CSOs must guarantee that a risk management assessment is undertaken to reduce the impacts of potential hazards in line with regulatory standards.\n- Finally, CSOs must set clear internal guidelines surrounding company procedures and employee behaviour.\n- ESG monitoring & reporting\n- CSOs hold a key responsibility to monitor the environmental, social and governance performance of the company or organisation, whilst also collecting relevant data and metrics following established reporting standards. Plan A provides a decarbonisation platform which streamlines this process.\n- Meanwhile, CSOs should compare this data with industry peers to establish benchmarks.\n- Finally, CSOs are responsible for the preparation and communication of the completed ESG report, thus ensuring transparency between internal and external stakeholders.\n- Managing a portfolio of sustainability projects\n- A CSO is responsible for tasks such as; planning, coordinating, reviewing progress, and tracking results to ensure the successful execution of various sustainability-focused operational efforts.\n- Managing stakeholder relationships\n- A CSO holds further responsibility to effectively manage stakeholders' relationships, and facilitate ongoing dialogue with both internal and external parties to cultivate sustainable, constructive and transparent relationships.\n- Managing a sustainability team\n- Primarily in larger companies, the Chief Sustainability Officer is responsible for leading a sustainability team.\n- Enhancing organisational abilities\n- CSOs are responsible for identifying gaps and determining appropriate educational initiatives to address them, such as addressing social factors via upskilling current staff or sourcing new talent.\n- Moreover, a CSO should also look for innovative ways to scale these newly acquired capabilities throughout the organisation.\n- Finally, A CSO is responsible for sharing and disseminating knowledge to ensure everyone has access to the necessary information and resources.\n- Liaising with C-Suite members\n- The Chief Sustainability Officer, being at the executive level, works closely alongside board members and other C-level positions - such as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO), and Chief Operating Officer (COO) - to guide corporate strategy and influence decision-making.\n- Leading with a culture of change\n- A CSO should lead with a culture that embraces change, firstly through assisting in defining and communicating the company or organisation\u2019s purpose.\n- The CSO is responsible for ensuring the provision of educational resources to assist the enablement of a culture of change to be championed organisation-wide.\n- Finally, a CSO must ensure routines are in place which reinforce such change, thus ensuring a \u2018walk the talk\u2019 culture is in place.\n- Seeking & experimenting with new technologies\n- CSOs should explore the external innovation ecosystem by utilising ESG-oriented technologies, solutions and practices to unlock enhanced value.\n- CSOs should oversee the utilisation of these practices by testing their applicability whilst simultaneously learning from experiments.\n- Subsequently, CSOs are responsible for overseeing the scaling and adoption of such practices within the wider company or organisation.\n- Ensuring sustainability is a central focus within business processes & decision-making\n- Accordingly, CSOs should embed sustainability into processes and decision-making, firstly via reviewing key processes and decision-making tools.\n- Furthermore, decision-makers must be adequately trained to ensure they can manage complex trade-offs.\nThe future of the Chief Sustainability Officer\nThe rise of the CSO won\u2019t be slowing down anytime soon.\nIn light of numerous climate-change-induced events occurring concurrently on a global scale, sustainability and ESG must be made key focal points for businesses to ensure future growth and security. Accordingly, acquiring a sustainability leader - namely a CSO - will be fundamental to shaping a successful strategy whilst maintaining a dynamic and innovative approach. Looking forward however, there must be clarity among the organisational structure, strategy and mission of the company to ensure the CSO can be as effective as possible within their role.\nA study found 41% of businesses integrated ESG criteria in the variable remuneration of managers and among the criteria taken into account, the number one was CO2 emission reduction. Meanwhile, 75% of CEOs stating that they expect ESG & sustainability management pressure to intensify over the next three years , the expected continuation in growth of CSO hires in the coming years reflects a necessity to meet the expectations of internal and external stakeholders. Some specific examples of factors driving this expansion include:\n- Companies are looking to bring CSOs on board to provide internal alignment and education to address growing demands from both employees and external stakeholders, particularly concerning their environmental footprint, health and safety, energy efficiency, and social responsibility.\n- There is therefore a growing pressure for companies and organisations to bring on a high-level external representative who can serve as a point of contact with internal and external stakeholders regarding key sustainability issues.\n- There is increasing pressure for companies to develop and implement a comprehensive sustainability strategy that is aligned with the company\u2019s specific business objectives and processes. A well-developed and implemented sustainability strategy is increasingly crucial in driving value creation.\n- An increase in ESG reporting requirements and directives necessitates a senior management position to oversee reporting issues and financial risk-related issues across various departments.\n- Finally, as found by PWC, companies with CSOs are better ESG performers and therefore have a competitive advantage.\nThe top stakeholders creating pressure to invest in sustainability initiatives.\nSource:\u00a0Gartner\nHow future CSOs set up management and oversight is crucial to the effective execution of their function. Furthermore, it is also crucial to the organisation\u2019s credibility on ESG and sustainability-related issues. Therefore, the future will inevitably see different firms requiring different types of CSOs to drive transformation.\nThe \u201cActivist,\u201d who takes direct and often drastic action to campaign for transformational change and achieve substantial environmental goals.\nSource:\u00a0Forrester Research\nMoreover, for future ESG strategies to be effectively implemented, it will be increasingly important for CSOs to focus upon:\n- Taking ownership of ALL of the aforementioned responsibilities.\n- Ensuring that not only sustainability but social and governance factors are also made a central focus within the wider ESG strategy.\n- Defining where there are gaps, and closing these gaps.\n\u200d\nThe desired positioning for a CSO for a German manufacturing company.\nSource: Harvard Business Review\nIn summary, companies can\u2019t sit on the fence. You\u2019re either part of the solution or part of the problem.\nGrowing societal and regulatory demands and increasing pressure from internal and external stakeholders pose vast financial risks to businesses that do not take action against climate change. Meanwhile, companies that do not implement an actionable and meaningful ESG strategy within their operations will not benefit from such value creation.\nFuture-proof your company's decarbonisation strategy with Plan A.

With the European Union introducing stringent regulations to combat greenwashing, companies now face potential penalties of up to 4% of their annual revenue for making misleading environmental claims.\nFrom the EU's Green Directive Claims to France's adoption of the \u201c Climate and Resiliance law \", the fight against greenwashing is gaining momentum. However, with gaps in legislation and an absence of standardised methods for calculating environmental footprints, there is still a lot of work to be done. In the meantime, businesses must proactively review and substantiate their environmental claims, implement standardised environmental labels, and invest in employee training. Moreover, they must implement rigorous carbon accounting to avoid legal consequences, and competitive disadvantages associated with greenwashing.\u00a0\nIn this article, we delve into the complex world of greenwashing regulations and their impact on businesses, shedding light on the steps companies must take to ensure compliance and maintain consumer trust in an era of increasing environmental consciousness.\u00a0\nWhat is greenwashing?\u00a0\nFor businesses, it's important to have a clear understanding of what greenwashing means. Greenwashing is a deceptive tactic used by companies to mislead consumers into thinking that their environmental efforts are more significant than they actually are. This misrepresentation is not only misleading but can also harm a company's reputation, damage customer trust, and ultimately hinder progress towards a sustainable future.\u00a0Greenwashing is an attempt to make people believe that your company is doing more to protect the environment than it is.\nIn simple terms, greenwashing is the practice of making false or exaggerated environmental claims that do not align with the company's actual practices or values. By avoiding greenwashing and committing to genuine sustainability efforts, businesses can build trust with consumers and contribute to a more environmentally conscious future.\nWhat to know about greenwashing regulations in the European Union\u00a0\nIn response to growing concerns about greenwashing, the EU has introduced regulations designed to curb these deceptive practices and ensure that businesses communicate their environmental performance accurately.\u00a0\nThe European Commission recognises greenwashing as an increasing issue , as it impeaches real climate action and leads to a less sustainable economy. To undertake this challenge, the European Green Deal states, \u201ccompanies making \u2018green claims\u2019 should substantiate these against a standard methodology to assess their impact on the environment\u201d. However, this specific statement does not clearly define what is meant by \u201cgreen claims\u201d and refers mainly to companies\u2019 goods and activities. To tackle greenwashing, we must agree on a common definition and make it mandatory for companies to support their claims with scientific evidence.\nThe European Commission has proposed the Green Claims Directive to combat greenwashing and promote transparency. The regulation establishes clear guidelines for companies to follow when making green claims, including substantiation requirements, prohibitions on misleading claims, and the use of standardised environmental labels. The regulation applies to all products and services marketed in the EU, regardless of the company's origin , and failure to comply can result in fines, sanctions, and product recalls.\nUnder the proposed Green Claims Directive, companies must have any covered green claims independently verified and supported with scientific evidence before communicating them. The verification process will be established and overseen by independent bodies under the control of EU member states. This applies not only to companies based in the EU but also to those outside the bloc that target EU consumers with green claims. The directive also includes measures to prevent unsubstantiated environmental claims and penalties for companies that engage in greenwashing. Small and medium-sized enterprises will receive help with compliance, and enforcement provisions are included.\nOn the other hand, the 2020 Circular Economy action plan commits that \u201cthe EU Commission will also propose that companies substantiate their environmental claims using Product and Organisation Environmental Footprint methods.\u201d Once again, this proposal is not a ratified or implemented regulation, meaning that it is not voted on yet and is not enforceable. Also, as long as there is no agreed framework method for calculating environmental footprint, this will be a rocky road.\nGreenwashing regulations in france: strengthening the legal framework\nFrance is in the process of adopting the recommendations of a civic assembly named \"La Loi Climat,\" which includes measures to combat greenwashing. Article 4 of the climate law makes \"greenwashing\" a deceptive commercial practice with reinforced sanctions. French consumers will benefit from among the highest levels of transparency globally with the mandatory display of the Eco-score on advertisements and products. The amount of the fine incurred for greenwashing can reach 80% of the cost of the promotional campaign, and the penalty must be advertised. However, it will be necessary to scrupulously verify this misleading communication.\u00a0\nThe 2021 Climate and Resilience Act in France has strengthened the legal framework against greenwashing and introduced new provisions in the French Environment Code. The Act prohibits any advertising related to fossil fuels and new cars with set levels of carbon dioxide emissions from 2028. In addition, any claim related to carbon neutrality or similar claims, such as \"climate-neutral\" or \"emission-free,\" must be supported by the advertiser's carbon footprint assessment over the entire life cycle of the product or service. These assessments must be made easily available to the public, along with the measures implemented to primarily avoid, reduce, and compensate for greenhouse gas emissions. Specific standards for conducting such assessments and disclosure requirements have been set as of 1 January 2023.\u00a0\nWhere does the legislation fall short today?\nA study commissioned by the European Commission in 2020 found that over half (53%) of green claims made by companies on their products and services were vague , misleading, or unfounded. Additionally, 40% of these claims were unsubstantiated, lacking evidence to support their environmental impact claims. Common phrases like \"eco-friendly,\" \"ethical,\" or \"sustainable\" were flagged as particularly problematic. These findings highlight the need for clear and consistent environmental labelling standards.\u00a0\nCurrently, there are around 230 different environmental labels used in the European Union, leading to confusion and distrust among consumers. To address this, regulators are working to establish more rigorous and standardized regulations to curb greenwashing practices and ensure companies are held accountable for their environmental claims.\u00a0\nWhile the EU's \"Green Claims Directive\" is a positive step towards greater transparency in environmental claims, it falls short in some areas. Advocacy groups have pointed out that the directive does not cover terms like \"carbon neutrality,\" which companies use to promote their products as environmentally friendly without taking meaningful steps towards sustainability. This means consumers may still be misled by companies using greenwashing tactics.\u00a0\nLindsay Otis, a policy expert on global carbon markets at Carbon Market Watch, believes the EU's failure to address this issue is a missed opportunity to hold corporations accountable for their environmental impact. The Commission acknowledges the problems created by greenwashing, but it does not go far enough to address them. Otis believes that the European Parliament and Council must enact stronger regulations that ban carbon neutrality claims, or else companies will continue to mislead consumers, hurting their trust and progress towards sustainable practices.\nIn summary, the EU's green claims directive is a positive step towards greater transparency, but it does not cover all tactics used by companies to deceive consumers. A stronger, more comprehensive regulatory framework is necessary to combat greenwashing and encourage businesses to adopt genuinely sustainable practices.\nHow will it impact companies?\nThe tightening of greenwashing regulations worldwide has significant implications for businesses. These include:\u00a0\n- Reputational damage : Companies found to be engaging in greenwashing can suffer severe reputational harm, resulting in a loss of consumer trust and potentially impacting their bottom line.\u00a0\n- Legal consequences : Non-compliance with greenwashing regulations can lead to legal actions, resulting in fines, penalties, or even the suspension of business operations in some cases.\u00a0\n- Increased compliance costs : To ensure adherence to greenwashing regulations, companies may need to invest in additional resources, such as hiring legal and sustainability experts or conducting third-party audits of their environmental claims.\u00a0\n- Competitive disadvantage : Companies that fail to comply with greenwashing regulations may find themselves at a competitive disadvantage, as consumers increasingly prioritise environmentally responsible products and services. \u200d\nHow can companies act on greenwashing and comply with regulations?\u00a0\nTo comply with the EU's greenwashing regulations and avoid misleading consumers, companies should take the following steps:\u00a0\n- Review and audit all marketing materials and environmental claims: Businesses should conduct a thorough review of their marketing materials and environmental claims to ensure they align with the regulations. This may involve consulting with legal and sustainability experts to identify potential areas of concern.\u00a0\n- Substantiate environmental claims: Companies must provide evidence to support their environmental claims, using credible and verifiable sources. This may include scientific studies, third-party certifications, or government data. Companies should be prepared to disclose this information if required by the regulations.\u00a0\n- Rigorous carbon accounting:\u00a0 To prove one\u2019s environmental impact, you will have to back it up with data. Companies must diverge from industry averages when calculating the footprint of a product or service. It is important to leverage primary activity data with already existing proof, for example, your scope 1 and 2 can be easily tracked through energy invoices, bills and such. Then, the golden share still is represented from scope 3 emissions , but it is important for companies to start backing up their claims with proof and data.\u00a0\n- Implement standardised environmental labels: The EU Commission promotes using standardised environmental labels, such as the EU Ecolabel , to provide consumers with reliable information about a product's environmental performance. Companies should consider adopting these labels where applicable to demonstrate compliance with the regulations.\u00a0\n- Train employees on greenwashing and regulations: Companies should provide training to their employees on greenwashing to ensure that all relevant personnel understand the implications of these regulations and can identify potential compliance issues.\u00a0\n- Continuously monitor and update marketing materials : Businesses should regularly review and update their marketing materials and environmental claims to ensure ongoing compliance with regulations. This may involve keeping abreast of new developments in sustainability research, as well as changes to the regulatory environment.\nCredit:\u00a0Plan\u00a0A\nBook a demo with Plan A for assistance in developing a sustainability strategy that adheres to regulations and helps your business thrive in the era of increasing environmental consciousness.\nRead more\nBilan Carbone: Your complete guide\nCorporate Sustainability\nDecarbonisation strategy: The comprehensive guide for 2024\nCorporate Sustainability\nDecarbonisation strategy for SMEs: Top 10 low-hanging fruits for immediate impact\nCorporate Sustainability\n10 Principles to End Greenwashing\nCorporate Sustainability\nHow to spot greenwashing\nCorporate Sustainability\nThe EU Taxonomy Regulation: a guide for companies\nPolicy & Regulations\nGet your company on the path to net-zero\nBook a call with our sustainability experts\nGet in touch", "source": "https://plana.earth/academy/how-eu-greenwashing-regulations-impact-business", "metadata": {"title": "How the EU greenwashing regulations will impact your business", "content": ["Greenwashing", "Regulations", "Policy", "Sustainability"]}}

Stakeholders , including investors, employees, and consumers, are becoming increasingly discerning in their expectations regarding corporate environmental responsibility. Therefore, formulating a comprehensive sustainability strategy is crucial. But equally significant is the ability to communicate that strategy effectively.\nThe major challenge, however, lies in identifying when and how to broadcast progress on sustainability endeavours. While some companies prefer to remain silent until substantial results are achieved, others involve their community, clients, and employees in every step of their journey, acknowledging that perfection is a constant pursuit. Nevertheless, the trend leans towards transparency and openness, encouraged by either legislation or competitive differentiation.\nThis article aims to guide you on effectively communicating your sustainability strategy by using responsible communication, fostering transparency, and engaging all stakeholders.\nUnderstanding the basics: Responsible communication\nHow to promote sustainability? An illustration by Laura Dunkley\nResponsible communication forms the bedrock of an effective sustainability strategy. Responsible communication is more than just sharing updates; it's about fostering transparency and authenticity in your interactions. It implies delivering clear, accurate, and consistent information, demonstrating your commitment to environmental stewardship.\u00a0\n\u200d\n1. Transparency: According to ADEME 's guidelines for responsible communication, transparency lies at the heart of responsible communication. Transparency extends beyond the sharing of success stories. It means being open about the challenges faced, areas needing improvement, and even failures. The more open a business is about its sustainability journey - the good and the bad - the more credibility it gains in the eyes of stakeholders.\nA great example of this is the Swedish fashion brand Filippa K . In its sustainability reports, the company openly acknowledges the complexities and challenges of transforming into a fully circular business, while also highlighting its progress and future goals. This transparency fosters trust, a crucial element in building strong stakeholder relationships.\n2. Accuracy : Responsible communication also requires accuracy. It's crucial to ensure the information shared about sustainability initiatives is factually correct, comprehensible, and avoids greenwashing . The credibility of a company's sustainability strategy is fundamentally grounded in the accuracy of its communication.\n3. Consistency: Lastly, consistency in communication is vital. Regular updates on sustainability efforts ensure stakeholders remain informed and engaged. Consistency also means maintaining alignment between words and actions, reinforcing the authenticity of a company's commitment to sustainability. Bringing these principles to life within an organisation requires a culture that values openness, embraces feedback, and commits to ongoing learning and improvement.\u00a0\nBy doing so, businesses can not only drive their sustainability agenda forward but also build a reputation as a responsible and trustworthy entity in the eyes of their stakeholders. In conclusion, responsible communication forms an integral part of communicating a sustainability strategy effectively.\nDeveloping and communicating your sustainability strategy\nHere is a step-by-step guide on formulating and communicating your sustainability strategy:\n\u200d\n1. Set clear and quantifiable goals\nYour sustainability strategy must have clear, quantifiable, and time-bound goals. This structure not only aids in internal execution but also offers a measurable framework to share with external stakeholders. In accordance with the United Nations directive to \u2018lead with science, \u2019 these goals should be grounded in scientific rigour, with a dedication to evidence, transparency, and accessibility. This is not just about being data-led but providing a new vision for consumers to embrace.\n\u200d\nTo illustrate the importance of clear goal-setting, consider the case of Unilever. Their \u2018 Sustainable Living Plan \u2019 published in 2010 had clear targets: by 2020, they aimed to halve the environmental footprint of the making and use of their products. By 2023, they were able to report a 47% reduction in CO2 emissions from energy per tonne of production, nearing their set target.\n2. Identify your key stakeholders\nUnderstanding who your key stakeholders are and what their sustainability expectations might be is paramount. They can be your customers, employees, investors, or even the wider community. It is also important to understand the value of the actions of these stakeholders towards sustainable lifestyles.\nA study by the MIT Sloan Management Review found that 88% of executives agreed that stakeholder engagement was important to their sustainability strategy. Meanwhile, according to a survey by PwC, 45% of investors want companies to identify the societal stakeholders they view as most important.\n3. Customise communication for each stakeholder group\nEach stakeholder group will have unique interests and expectations regarding your sustainability efforts. Therefore, your communication strategy should be tailored to resonate with each of them. For example, the United Nations encourages companies to ' change behaviours and practices ,' which means providing a new vision for stakeholders that allows them to understand their role in promoting sustainable practices.\nFor instance, a 2023 Nielsen study showed that 74% of Millennials and Gen Z are willing to pay more for sustainable goods , demonstrating that emphasising sustainability in consumer communication can positively impact sales among these demographics.\n4. Update stakeholders\nPeriodically inform your stakeholders about your progress. Be open about your challenges and successes. For instance, Ganni , a Danish clothing brand, publishes annual sustainability reports, giving its stakeholders an authentic view of their journey.\n5. Seek feedback\nActively engage with your stakeholders and seek their feedback on your sustainability strategy and communication. This interactive approach will not only keep them involved but can also provide valuable insights and support broader sustainable change.\nA survey revealed that businesses that incorporate stakeholder perspectives into their strategies are 26% more likely to outperform their industry peers on profitability . This underlines the potential value of stakeholder feedback . In conclusion, effective communication of your sustainability strategy requires clear goal-setting, understanding and engaging with stakeholders and maintaining open, transparent dialogue. With these practices, businesses can achieve both their sustainability goals and enhance their reputation in the marketplace.\nGuidelines on sustainable communication for fashion companies. These can be applied beyond the scope of the fashion industry.\nCredit: United Nations\nImplementing best practices: Chlo\u00e9's case study\nOne company that stands out in responsible communication of their sustainability strategy is the luxury fashion house, Chlo\u00e9. Their approach has been characterised by bold transparency. They have openly communicated their strategic shift towards more responsible materials and their ambition to reach a 30% reduction per product by 2025, according to their targets. The brand also holds open forums, inviting clients, employees, and experts to discuss their sustainability progress and plans.\u00a0\nChlo\u00e9 is the first luxury fashion company to obtain a B Corp certification.\nCredit: Chlo\u00e9\nIn 2022, Chlo\u00e9 launched a series of initiatives, including a biodiversity footprint assessment using the Global Biodiversity Score tool and following the framework set by Sciences Based Targets for Nature. This tool enables them to quantify and analyse the impact of their activity ( scope 1, 2 and 3 ) on biodiversity, according to the main pressures on ecosystems. These moves, backed by transparent and frequent communication, have significantly boosted Chlo\u00e9's reputation among its stakeholders.\nLeveraging digital platforms for communication\nIn this digital age, myriad platforms are available to disseminate your sustainability strategy. Corporate websites, newsletters, social media channels, webinars, and podcasts can effectively reach out to diverse stakeholder groups. Each platform presents unique opportunities for interactive and dynamic content, fostering deeper engagement.\nA leading resource in this regard is Plan A's Sustainability Platform . Plan A has established itself as a powerful tool in aiding businesses to communicate their sustainability strategies. The platform is filled with resources and guides that businesses can use to communicate their sustainability strategy responsibly. It also provides carbon accounting and decarbonisation tools, including corporate carbon footprint (CCF) calculators , decarbonisation target setting and reduction strategies . One of Plan A's standout features is its in-depth guides on responsible communication. These guides shed light on new initiatives and address challenges in the sustainability journey , thereby fostering a sense of community among users. The platform also provides relevant data and insights, which can significantly enhance the effectiveness of communication strategies.\nThe key to utilising these platforms effectively lies in tailoring your message to suit each platform's unique characteristics and the audience they reach. For instance, social media channels are excellent for visual storytelling or sharing milestone updates, while platforms like Plan A, with its innovative technology, experts articles and comprehensive guides, can delve into more nuanced aspects of your sustainability strategy.\nBuilding a sustainable corporate culture\u00a0\nCommunicating your sustainability strategy isn't just about external stakeholders; it's equally crucial to engage your employees in this journey. A sustainable corporate culture can be a powerful driver for achieving your sustainability goals.\nInvolve your employees in sustainability initiatives, provide them with regular updates, and encourage their input. Remember, your employees are not just part of your organisation, but they are also customers, community members, and influencers in their networks. A great example of this is Patagonia , an outdoor clothing company that is renowned for its commitment to sustainability. Patagonia not only communicates its sustainability strategy to its customers but also involves its employees deeply in its sustainability initiatives.\nOvercoming challenges in communication\nCommunicating your sustainability strategy is not without its challenges. For instance, ' greenwashing ', or the act of conveying misleading information about a company's environmental practices, is a significant concern. All claims must be backed by solid evidence to maintain credibility and avoid scepticism.\nAnother challenge is the complexity of sustainability issues . It can be challenging to communicate these complex issues in a way that is easily understood by all stakeholders. To overcome this, it's important to use clear, straightforward language and provide context to help your audience understand the relevance of the issue. Furthermore, communication must be consistent. Inconsistent messages can create confusion and damage credibility. This necessitates a well-coordinated approach to ensure that all communication channels and departments are delivering a unified message.\nThe power of partnerships\nSustainability is not a journey that businesses need to undertake alone. Partnerships with NGOs, industry bodies, or even other businesses can provide valuable support and add credibility to your sustainability strategy. Such collaborations can also present opportunities for joint communication initiatives, providing a larger platform to share your sustainability strategy.\u00a0\nTake IKEA, for example. The retail giant partners with various organisations , including the WWF and the United Nations, to drive its sustainability initiatives. These partnerships have not only helped IKEA achieve significant milestones but also boosted the credibility of its communication.\nList of actions to communicate on your sustainability strategy.\nCredit: Plan A\nAs the world shifts towards a more sustainable future, the way businesses communicate their sustainability strategies will play a pivotal role in their success. Responsible communication, stakeholder engagement, and transparency are the cornerstones of an effective communication strategy.\nBy setting clear goals, regularly updating stakeholders, seeking feedback, and fostering a sustainable corporate culture, businesses can navigate the journey towards sustainability with their stakeholders by their side.\nRemember, in sustainability, it's not just about doing the right thing. It's also about communicating it right.\u00a0Book a demo with Plan A today.\nRead more\nBilan Carbone: Your complete guide\nCorporate Sustainability\nDecarbonisation strategy: The comprehensive guide for 2024\nCorporate Sustainability\nDecarbonisation strategy for SMEs: Top 10 low-hanging fruits for immediate impact\nCorporate Sustainability\n6 key steps to ESG reporting\nPolicy & Regulations\nHow to spot greenwashing\nCorporate Sustainability\nHow to prepare a sustainability budget in 2023\nCorporate Sustainability\nGet your company on the path to net-zero\nBook a call with our sustainability experts\nGet in touch", "source": "https://plana.earth/academy/communicating-sustainability-strategy-transparency-responsibility", "metadata": {"title": "Communicating your sustainability strategy: A guide to transparency and responsibility", "content": ["Communication", "Sustainability"]}}

Whilst the broad aim of the directive is to promote sustainable and responsible corporate behaviour, the rules will inevitably require companies to identify and address the environmental and social impact of their activities and value chains, whilst also mandating that companies adopt and implement climate transition plans.\u00a0\nAccordingly, this article will focus on the purpose of the CSDDD, who the CSDDD applies to, and how businesses can not only prepare for, but leverage, the opportunities associated with the forthcoming CSDD Directive.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat is the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD)?\nThe detrimental effects of climate change upon both the environment and humanity, coupled with the critical role that businesses play\u00a0 in paving the way towards a sustainable economy and society, has seen immense pressure from a broad range of stakeholder groups. In an attempt to shape a more sustainable global economy and society, these groups have therefore been calling for businesses to be subject to mandatory due diligence rules - with over 70% of the businesses who responded to the public consultation clearly calling for EU action on corporate sustainability\u00a0\nIn response, lawmakers within the European Parliament have confirmed that the CSDDD will be introduced in an attempt to ensure that businesses address adverse impacts of their actions, including in their value chains inside and outside of Europe. The core elements of the CSDDD include identifying, preventing, mitigating and accounting for negative environmental and human impacts of the company's wider operations. The directive seeks to achieve such aims through providing guidance and incentives to directors to contribute to sustainability and climate change mitigation goals, and via mandates - such as requiring certain large companies to develop and implement a sustainability strategy.\n\u200d Read more on the importance of ESG regulations in facilitating business climate action\nWho does the EU CSDDD apply to?\u00a0\nThe EU expects the directive to directly impact around 13,000 companies within the EU and approximately 4,000 outside the EU.\n\u200d Large EU limited liability companies: The first group of businesses affected by the CSDDD are large EU limited liability companies, which includes companies across two key sub-groups.\n- Group 1: Companies with 500+ employees, and \u20ac150m+ net turnover worldwide. This group has been estimated to consist of around 9,400 companies.\u00a0\n- Group 2: Companies with 250+ employees, \u20ac40m+ net turnover worldwide, and is estimated to include around 3,400 companies operating in defined high impact sectors (e.g. textiles, agriculture, extraction of minerals). The rules start to apply to group 2 two years later than for group 1.\nNon-EU companies: Meanwhile, an estimate of around 4,000 non-EU companies fall under the scope of the directive. These companies operate as \u2018third country\u2019 companies, yet still generate turnover in the EU which aligns with the threshold of groups 1 and 2.\n\u200d Micro-companies and small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs): Finally, whilst micro companies and SMEs are not directly affected by the forthcoming rules; the directive provides several key supporting measures for smaller companies which must be accounted for by businesses who wish to not only mitigate sustainability risk, but also reap the long-term strategic benefits of decarbonisation .\u00a0\nFor an overview of the key requirements of the forthcoming directive, download Plan A\u2019s CSDDD policy factsheet.\nThe requirements of the CSDDD\n- Due diligence: Most importantly, CSDDD affected companies will have to ensure that due diligence is a key factor within policy development and implementation.\n- Impact identification: Companies which fall under the scope of the CSDD Directive will have to take the appropriate measures to identify the actual or potential adverse environmental and human rights impacts of their operations, their subsidiaries and their supply chain.\n- Risk mitigation: CSDDD affected businesses will then be required to actively mitigate the identified risks within their own operations, as well as the operations of their wider supply chain.\u00a0\n- Action plan: Companies\u00a0which fall under the scope of the CSDDD will be mandated to develop and implement not only an action plan, but also a timeline for addressing the identified environmental and social risks of their operations.\n- Grievance mechanisms: CSDDD affected companies will be required to establish grievance mechanisms for workers and stakeholders in order for them to raise issues if they arise.\n- Align with targets: Ultimately, CSDDD influenced companies will ultimately be required to align their business model and strategy with the 1.5\u00b0C target of the Paris Agreement;\n- Reporting: Last but not least, companies will be mandated to develop and publicly publish sustainability reports with a key focus on due diligence.\u00a0\nThe benefits of the CSDDD\nThe European Commission has identified a range of opportunities and benefits associated with the directive applicable to all stakeholders of climate change ; however if businesses do not prioritise sustainability and leverage such opportunities, they will inevitably be subject to vast financial and non-financial risks.\u00a0\nFor companies , the key benefits and opportunities associated with the CSDDD include:\n- A harmonised legal framework in the EU, creating legal certainty and level playing field.\n- Greater customer trust and employees\u2019 commitment.\n- Better risk management and adaptability.\n- Better access to finance.\nFor citizens , the key benefits and\u00a0 opportunities associated with the EU CSDDD include:\n- Better protection of human rights, including labour rights.\n- Healthier environment for present and future generations.\n- Increased trust in businesses.\nFor developing countries , the key benefits and opportunities associated with the EU CSDDD include:\n- Better protection of human rights and the environment.\n- Increased stakeholder awareness on key sustainability issues.\n- Sustainable investment.\n- Increased take-up of international standards.\nHow to prepare for the CSDDD\nUltimately, the most important step which businesses must take when preparing for the CSDDD is to prioritise sustainability immediately. As a first step, it is highly recommended that businesses are proactive in taking measures that place sustainability as a central strategic focus, such as:\n- Collecting and monitoring operational data from business operations, suppliers, and partners to identify risks in the supply chain, and for inclusion in sustainability reports.\u00a0\n- Leveraging the power of sustainability software to develop and implement a sustainability strategy that aligns with the latest relevant sustainability and ESG regulations, policies and trends.\n- Engaging with stakeholders in order to reduce scope 3 emissions .\u00a0\n- Developing and publishing sustainability reports in line with key reporting frameworks.\u00a0\nCredit:\u00a0Plan A\nSpotlight: CSDDD vs CSRD\nThe Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) are not mutually exclusive; and are intended to be applied in tandem by corporate entities who fall under the scope of both directives .\u00a0\nThe CSDDD outlines mandatory due diligence companies must implement regarding the environmental and human rights impacts along their supply chains. Meanwhile, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) serves as the primary reporting mechanism for which corporations will report on their sustainability actions. While the CSDDD is being introduced in an attempt to ensure that businesses address adverse impacts of their actions, including in their value chains inside and outside Europe, the CSRD aims to improve the transparency and consistency of sustainability reporting by companies operating in the EU, and is part of a broader trend towards increased disclosure and transparency around climate-related risks and opportunities.\nDespite the different focus points of each directive, both proposals cite the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights as the main international due diligence frameworks. \u200d\nRead more on how businesses can prepare for the CSRD here.\u00a0\nCredit: Plan A\nTo be fully prepared for the EU\u2019s Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, businesses must not only start collecting data, but develop and implement a comprehensive sustainability strategy across their wider supply chain.

The fundamentals of Corporate Social Responsibility\n\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Cette page est en cours de traduction en Fran\u00e7ais.\n\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Diese Seite wird derzeit ins Deutsche \u00fcbersetzt.\nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has increasingly become a 'must-have', rather than a 'nice-to-have', for all businesses.\nCorporate Sustainability\nCSR\nSustainability\nJuly 18, 2023\nWill Basil-Jones\nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR) refers to a company or organisation's commitment to operating in a sustainable and ethical manner, whilst simultaneously addressing the needs of its stakeholders and society. Foundational upon the idea that a business has a responsibility to the society that exists around it, CSR can be seen as a form of self-regulation businesses take on through the expression of sustainable initiatives and strategies. While different organisations display different forms of \u2018social responsibility\u2019, companies are often guided by the \u2018triple bottom line\u2019. The triple bottom line dictates that businesses should be committed to channelling their efforts towards profit, people, and the planet.\u00a0\nIn today\u2019s rapidly changing business environment, CSR has quickly emerged as a must-know term used to describe a company\u2019s ethical, social, and environmental responsibilities. The exponential growth of this term reflects the immense growing pressure companies are facing from internal and external stakeholders to extend their strategy beyond profit-making towards a strategy that positively contributes to society and the environment. As such, businesses are realising that CSR is quickly becoming a must-have, rather than a nice-to-have. Accordingly, this comprehensive article will delve into the definition of CSR, the benefits of CSR for businesses, CSR implementation strategies, and the key role CSR plays in shaping a sustainable future.\nThe fundamentals of Corporate Social Responsibility in business\u00a0\nAll CSR strategies generally involve prioritising environmental and social concerns within a businesses key operational and decision-making processes; however, there are various levels of responsibility that business leaders must consider when developing a CSR strategy. Here are the fundamentals you should be looking for:\u00a0\n- Environmental : Environmental responsibility is a vital pillar of CSR, and entails minimising a company\u2019s negative impact on the environment via the adoption of sustainable practices. At the heart of integrating environmental factors into a company\u2019s strategy is implementing CSR initiatives focusing on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) , such as carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). For example, a key CSR environmental initiative which businesses often implement involves utilising sustainability software to identify inefficiencies in energy usage. Businesses can then improve their energy efficiency and reduce waste through actions such as going digital. Businesses who prioritise the environment via the implementation of decarbonisation strategies will ultimately reap the long term financial and non-financial benefits of sustainability .\u00a0\n- Social : Social responsibility is a fundamental component of any effective CSR strategy, and involves placing a key focus upon the wellbeing of employees, communities, and society. For example, businesses may exert a focus upon the social aspect of CSR through ensuring that diversity, equity and inclusion is a key consideration within all recruitment and training processes; thus ensuring a safe(r) workplace for all individuals. Companies who strive to translate their social responsibility into real action should prioritise the implementation of CSR initiatives that ensure fair labour practices, maximise workplace safety, support diversity and inclusion, foster employee development, and actively contribute to community initiatives.\n- Ethical: Ethical responsibility is a key component of CSR, and it revolves around ensuring that all business activities are ethical and transparent. Companies express their ethical responsibility through channelling their efforts towards CSR practices that guarantee they adhere to laws and regulations , promote honesty and integrity in their business practices, strengthen human rights throughout their supply chain, and combat corruption. For instance, companies may seek expert guidance from a third party regarding the latest ESG and sustainability regulations influencing their operations, thus ensuring they can take proactive action to stay ahead of the curve.\nThe 5 key benefits of CSR for businesses\nResource efficiency and cost savings\n\u200d The implementation of a CSR strategy is fundamental to maximising resource efficiency. Businesses that identify and implement measures to enhance operational efficiency, minimise energy consumption, and reduce waste generation hold the opportunity to ascertain substantial cost savings through lower energy bills, reduced raw material usage, and optimised supply chain operations. For instance, research by McKinsey highlighted a\u00a0 60% potential improvement in operating profits via the reduction of resource costs.\u00a0\nRegulatory compliance\nBusinesses who implement a balanced CSR strategy will ensure they can not only ensure compliance, but also stay ahead of evolving regulations. Businesses that take a proactive approach towards meeting changing social and environmental standards will ultimately\u00a0 mitigate the immense risks associated with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) regulations -\u00a0 such as facing financial penalties and legal issues. Accordingly, high to severe ESG incidents have been found to lead to 6% loss of market capitalisation on average.\u00a0\nInvestor and stakeholder expectations\n\u200d Oxford University found that more than 80% of mainstream investors now consider \u2018ESG\u2019 information when making investment decisions, and they often prefer to invest in companies with robust sustainability practices. As such, companies who aim to continuously bolster their CSR efforts will attract a broader range of investors and access capital more easily . Meanwhile, by actively engaging with stakeholders - such as employees, customers, investors, and communities - companies can build stronger and more collaborative relationships. This facilitates increased loyalty, support, and long-term partnerships.\nEnhanced brand reputation\u00a0\nCompanies that prioritise CSR will not only mitigate the risk of reputational damage, but also often improvements in consumer trust and brand reputation. By demonstrating a commitment to social and environmental issues, businesses can differentiate themselves and build stronger connections with customers who value responsible practices . Such engagement will deliver an increase in sales due to an increase in customer loyalty and satisfaction; with findings highlighting up to a 60% increase in customer commitment\nTalent attraction and retention\nA comprehensive approach to CSR can attract and retain top talent by showcasing a company's commitment to increasingly-prioritised values. With findings showing that 67% of millennials expect the companies they work for to be purpose-driven and their jobs to have a societal impact; employees are more likely to be engaged and motivated when they work for an organisation that aligns with their personal beliefs and contributes positively to society. As such, companies who exert their commitment to CSR via the implementation of a comprehensive sustainability strategy have been found to realise up to a 13% increase in employee productivity, and up to a 50% reduction in turnover.\nThe various financial and non-financial benefits of Corporate Social Responsibility, ot CSR, for businesses.\u00a0Credit:\u00a0Plan A\nHow to implement a CSR strategy\nWhile CSR is absolutely vital to building a more sustainable future, it is just as critical to building a future-proof business. Businesses who implement an aligned CSR strategy will hold the potential to mitigate vast levels of risk, whilst leveraging an array of cost-saving benefits in order to ascertain a long-term competitive advantage. In order to ensure the efficient and effective implementation of a CSR strategy, businesses must:\nSet clear objectives and targets\u00a0\nAs a first step, businesses who wish to reap the long term benefits of CSR and sustainability must\u00a0 establish measurable goals that align with the company's values and the expectations of stakeholders. These objectives should be specific, attainable, and time-bound to provide a clear direction for sustainability and CSR practices.\nIntegrate environmental and social concerns into core business practices\u00a0\nSubsequently, businesses must ensure that they integrate CSR concerns into the company's overall strategy and operations. This involves company\u2019s embedding CSR principles into decision-making processes, supply chain management, product development, and corporate governance. For instance, an increasingly mandatory CSR initiative that companies are undertaking is the collection and monitoring of operational data across the wider supply chain for inclusion in sustainability reports, carbon footprint reduction, and to identify supply chain risks.\nPursue alignment between stakeholders\u00a0\nCSR initiatives require clear, consistent communication with various stakeholders - such as employees, customers, investors, communities and the environment. Involving stakeholders in CSR communications and decision-making processes fosters collaboration, enables diverse perspectives, and ensures that CSR initiatives address relevant issues. Meanwhile,\u00a0 regular communication and feedback loops enable companies to understand stakeholder expectations and make informed decisions.\nRead here for a comprehensive guide to managing stakeholders in the net-zero transition.\u00a0\nLeverage the power of sustainability technology to monitor, report and improve upon sustainability performance\u00a0\nCompanies should establish robust monitoring systems to track performance on CSR, evaluate outcomes, and identify areas for improvement. Sustainability leaders that ensure that organisation wide and value-chain wide sustainability assessments are periodically undertaken, and that sustainability performance data is rigorously measured and analysed will be able to comprehensively understand the requirements to meet their sustainability goals . Meanwhile, transparent reporting enables stakeholders to assess the company's progress and hold it accountable for its commitments. Accordingly, it is highly recommended that companies aiming to leverage the opportunities associated with CSR consider the utilisation of sustainability software . Leveraging the power of sustainability software to develop and implement a sustainability strategy that aligns with the latest relevant sustainability and ESG regulations, policies and trends is vital to the development of a dynamic and innovative decarbonisation strategy.\u00a0\nUltimately, CSR plays a fundamental role in addressing some of the world's most pressing challenges, such as climate change and inequality. Through aligning business interests with societal needs, companies contribute to the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs ) and create a more equitable and sustainable world for future generations. While Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has evolved from a philanthropic add-on to a core business strategy that businesses will be forced to implement, businesses that channel their efforts towards shaping a sustainable future will ultimately reap the\u00a0 long-term strategic benefits of CSR and sustainability.\nInterested in paving the way towards a more sustainable future?

While much of the sun\u2019s energy reflects off the Earth\u2019s surface and escapes back into space, greenhouse gases effectively capture some of this energy, reflect it, and thereby warm the planet. An excess of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, driven by human activity since the industrial revolution, has led to rising temperatures and an escalating climate crisis.\u00a0\nThis article will explain what greenhouse gases are and why human-caused emissions fuel climate change. But before we explore greenhouse gases and the greenhouse effect, it is helpful first to understand the role of our atmosphere in regulating our Earth\u2019s temperature.\nWhat is the greenhouse effect?\nImagine for a moment the Earth had no atmosphere. The sun, roughly 93 million miles from Earth , sends electromagnetic radiation, warming the Earth\u2019s surface. This warming would, in turn, release electromagnetic radiation back into space. Without an atmosphere with greenhouse gases to capture some of that heat, the energy would return to space, and the Earth would be much colder than it is today. Without the greenhouse effect, the global mean temperature would be -18\u00b0C and therefore uninhabitable for humans.\u00a0\nHow does our atmosphere help regulate the temperature of our planet and its climate?\nThe greenhouse effect occurs mostly in our troposphere , which is our lower atmosphere. Our troposphere is composed mainly of nitrogen and oxygen. Argon, carbon dioxide, water vapour, methane, and other gases are in low concentrations and comprise about 1% of the troposphere.\nThese gases can capture electromagnetic radiation that would otherwise be radiated back into space. These gases are known as \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d because they trap this energy, or heat, in the atmosphere and warm the Earth. The ability of these greenhouse gases to capture and retain heat that otherwise would have been lost, thereby warming the Earth, is called the greenhouse effect . Thanks to the greenhouse effect, our planet\u2019s average temperature is a comfortable 15\u00b0C.\u00a0\nHow do we measure the potency of greenhouse gases?\nWhile carbon dioxide, water vapour, and methane are the most commonly known, many other greenhouse gases exist. Some occur in nature, and others are industrial. Greenhouse gases are described using two main indicators: Global Warming Potential - a relative measure of how much heat a greenhouse gas traps in the atmosphere; and the atmospheric lifetime - which measures the lifetime of the gas in the atmosphere.\nThe first indicator expresses itself in CO 2 equivalent (how much more or less the effect on the climate is of this greenhouse gas compared to the CO 2 effect set as a reference equal to 1). This effect on the climate is known as the global warming potential, or GWP. GWP is defined as the amount of heat absorbed by any greenhouse gas in the atmosphere as a multiple of the heat that would be absorbed by the same mass of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). The second indicator, atmospheric lifetime, indicates the time it takes for the gas to disappear from the atmosphere.\u00a0\u00a0\nYou can get a preliminary idea of your company\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions by using Plan A\u2019s free carbon scanner .\u00a0\nWhat are some greenhouse gases to be familiar with?\nCarbon dioxide (or CO 2 ) is a colourless, odourless gas consisting of one part carbon and two parts oxygen. CO 2 is a natural component of our planet's atmosphere and is one of the most commonly known greenhouse gases.\u00a0\nBecause humanity releases more carbon dioxide \u2013primarily through burning fossil fuels like coal and oil\u2013 into the atmosphere than current biological processes can remove, the amount and concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and ocean increases yearly.\nMethane (CH 4 ), a primary constituent of natural gas, is a greenhouse gas, and its presence in the atmosphere affects our climate system and the Earth's temperature.\nAlthough CO 2 has a longer-lasting effect on our climate, methane has a much higher Global Warming Potential (GWP) than carbon dioxide.\nAccording to the Environmental Defence Fund, methane accounts for at least 25% of today's global warming. Agriculture (primarily through manure and gastroenteric releases, but also through rice cultivation) is responsible for around a quarter of the methane emissions, followed by the energy sector.\nNitrous oxide (N 2 O), also known as laughing gas, contributes to the greenhouse effect.\nIn addition to natural sources, agriculture and fertilisers produce nitrous oxide. Around 40% of the total N2O emissions globally come from human activities. The IPCC has calculated that nitrous oxide comprises about 6% of all greenhouse gas emissions, and its emissions rose 30% in the past forty years.\nWater Vapor is Earth\u2019s most abundant greenhouse gas and is responsible for about half of Earth\u2019s greenhouse effect.\u00a0As temperatures increase, the rate of water evaporation also increases. This water vapour remains in the lower atmosphere, where it absorbs radiation and pushes it down to the Earth\u2019s surface, causing already hot temperatures to continue to rise. This creates a feedback loop, as water vapour is a greenhouse gas that becomes more abundant the warmer the planet becomes.\u00a0\nHydrofluorocarbons refrigerants are found in everything from air conditioning systems to home refrigerators,\u00a0 grocery store freezers, and industrial warehouses. The majority of the gases used in refrigerants are hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs. HFCs are hundreds to thousands of times more potent a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Therefore, limiting the emissions of these gases is crucial to limit global warming, as is ensuring their safe disposal.\nSulfur hexafluoride: The most dangerous greenhouse gas \u200d\nSulfur hexafluoride (SF 6 ) is the most potent of all greenhouse gases, with a global warming potential 23,900 times the baseline of CO 2 . SF 6 is synthetic and does not have a natural sink or effective disposal methods. Thus, when emitted, SF 6 simply accumulates in the atmosphere. SF 6 \u2019s atmospheric lifetime can be up to 3,200 years, well beyond CO 2 \u2018s atmospheric lifetime.\u00a0\nThe energy industry is SF 6 \u2019s biggest consumer\u2013 it consumes more than 80% of the gas. SF 6 is mostly used inside switchgear \u2013 an essential component of any electricity grid.\u00a0 They are also used inside wind turbines, meaning neither wind energy, nor electricity, in general, can be claimed to be completely environmentally friendly.\nWhat do greenhouse gases have to do with climate change?\nThe greenhouse effect is a natural part of our planet, and it keeps our average mean temperature steady, allowing life to flourish. So why is it associated with climate change and global warming? This is due to human activity, which has raised the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to unnaturally high levels. Humanity has been amplifying the greenhouse effect since the industrial revolution by burning oil, coal and natural gas for energy.\nThe emissions from these fossil fuels is drastically altering our atmosphere\u2019s composition. Unfortunately, our global economy currently relies on fossil fuels for energy. To solve the climate crisis and reverse global warming, there is an urgent need to decarbonise business. You can find out where your business stands regarding emissions with Plan A\u2019s end-to-end decarbonisation software .\u00a0\nThe burning of fossil fuels, changes in land use, the creation of potent new molecules, industrial farming practices, deforestation, and the use of artificial fertilisers are among the human activities leading to an increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Over the last 100 years, the level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has risen by 25% . According to the IPCC, an estimated 59 billion tonnes of GHG were emitted in 2019,\u00a0largely carbon dioxide.\u00a0\nGreenhouse gas concentrations levels have skyrocketed above pre-industrial levels.\nSource: Climate Central\nHow have rising greenhouse gases impacted our climate?\nDue to the increase in greenhouse gas emissions, the planet\u2019s average temperature has already risen by 1.2\u00b0Celsius since pre-industrial times. This may not seem like a lot on a planet whose climate ranges from that of Antarctica to that of the Sahara, but this variation has already had devastating impacts on our planet\u2019s ecosystems, landscapes, and day-to-day life. The most immediate, perceptible symptoms are natural disasters such as droughts, floods, and wildfires. According to the UN\u2019s disaster-monitoring system, the number of natural disasters has almost quadrupled since 1970.\nIn recap, here are some important points to remember about greenhouse gases:\n- Greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere\n- The greenhouse effect is a natural process that has allowed life to flourish on earth\n- However, the burning of fossil fuels have led to an excessive amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere\n- Global warming is caused by these excess greenhouse gases\n- Decarbonisation, or the reduction of greenhouse gases being emitted through human activities, is essential to stop global warming\nHow can we solve the problem of excessive greenhouse gases in our atmosphere?\nThe science is clear: Greenhouse gases are being emitted into the atmosphere at alarming rates, raising the Earth\u2019s temperature and driving catastrophic climate change. It seems everywhere we turn, there are new natural disasters and disruptions. But there is a silver lining: we know exactly what drives this crisis and what needs to be done. Decarbonisation stops emissions from being released in the first place and carbon sequestration captures and stores the excess carbon in the atmosphere. Both are essential solutions to the climate crisis.\u00a0\nWhat role can businesses play in lowering greenhouse gas emissions?\nThe ways we do business are currently emitting dangerous amounts of greenhouse gases into our Earth\u2019s atmosphere. However, business sustainability strategies such as carbon accounting and implementing science-based decarbonisation targets can be powerful levers for change.\u00a0\nSome ways a business can lower its emissions are:\n- Switching to a renewable energy provider\n- Moving events online and avoiding air travel\n- Encouraging employees to bike or ride public transit to the office\n- Switching your vehicle fleet to electric\n- Managing waste efficiently\nPlan A knows that every fossil fuel that remains in the ground, every refrigerant that is not released into the atmosphere, and every kilowatt of energy saved makes a difference.

But what is ESG and why does it matter to a business\u2019s performance? ESG is an acronym that stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance. It is a framework used to measure a business's non-financial performance in environmental, social and governance categories. ESG was coined in 2004 by former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, resulting in 2005 with the first study, \u201cWho cares Wins\u201d developed jointly with the world\u2019s largest institutional investors.\nWhy is ESG important for businesses?\n\u200d Across the EU and the UK, key ESG reporting regulations, such as the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), covering more than 75% of European companies\u2019 turnover . ESG has become an important way for investors, consumers, and potential employees to access the attractiveness and sustainability of a business.\u00a0\n\"ESG is likely to play a bigger role in how companies are assessed, not only by investors but by consumers and stakeholders\", explains Nathan Bonnisseau , Co-Founder at Plan A. \"The numbers reflect a growing awareness that companies must manage their environmental impact in innovative ways to remain successful. Sustainability is the new ideal, and the development of sophisticated methods of evaluating ESG activities and effect, is the key to attaining it,\" he adds. Plan A has an extensive suite of reporting templates and tools to bring your business\u2019s ESG reporting to the next level.\nHow does ESG add value to businesses?\nESG has become an integral part of assessing a company\u2019s value. It has been demonstrated that companies performing well on ESG practices have higher financial growth and optimisation, lower volatility, higher employee productivity, reduced regulatory and legal interventions (fines and sanctions), top-line growth, and cost reductions. On the other hand, companies that performed poorly on ESG noticed a higher cost of capital, higher volatility due to controversies and other incidences such as labour strikes, fraud accounting and other governance irregularities.\u00a0\n\u00a0There are clear advantages to optimising ESG performance, such as:\n- High ESG performance makes your company more attractive to VCs and other private equity investors.\n- Integrating ESG gives you a clear competitive advantage. Studies have found that 88% of companies that adhered to social and environmental standards showed better operational development.\u00a0\n- ESG optimisation allows you to get ahead of the curve and be prepared for upcoming reporting and regulation requirements.\n- ESG reporting gives you clarity on your business\u2019s impact and allows you to avoid greenwashing and the negative PR that can come from it. It is no longer acceptable to make unsubstantiated sustainability claims, and businesses risk their reputations if they do not have an integrated ESG strategy.\n- High ESG scores allow you to attract and retain the best talent. 67% of millennials expect the companies they work for to be purpose-driven and their jobs to have a societal impact.\nWhat is ESG measuring?\nESG stands for Environmental, Social and Governance and is an important, if still emerging, framework for measuring a company\u2019s non-financial performance. Before the onset of ESG reporting, financial reporting and capital dominated how investors measure company performance. But in an era marked by climate change, investors, consumers, employees, and business owners alike are looking for more comprehensive and inclusive ways of measuring a company\u2019s performance and impact.\u00a0\nWhat are the three pillars of ESG?\nE: Environmental\u00a0\nThe Environmental pillar considers the impact a business has on the planet. Top of mind in this category is a company\u2019s record on climate, its greenhouse gas emissions and overall carbon footprint. Measures such as accurate and up-to-date carbon accounting, reporting, and decarbonisation plans are critical in this area.\u00a0\nBut the E in ESG does not stop at a company\u2019s climate impacts. Other considerations to measure and account for are water pollution, water use, and air pollution. In addition, business report on land use practices that affect deforestation and biodiversity in this category. Finally, a company\u2019s recycling policy and whether or not it has a circular economic model also impact its score.\u00a0\nThe E in ESG is the most complex to gather data on, particularly as up to 90% of a company\u2019s emissions can be attributed to Scope 3 emissions, which can be challenging to report.\u00a0\nWant to learn how Plan A helps you report and reduce your Scope 3 emissions? Read about our Supplier Module here .\nS: Social\nThe Social pillar in ESG reports on a company\u2019s human impact, from its employees and consumers to the communities within which a company operates. Employee and labour practices, health and safety standards, mental health, customer success, and community relations are all reported in this category. Companies also report on issues of equity, including gender and diversity inclusion. Customer success, including product liabilities \u201cregarding the safety and quality of their product,\u201d is also considered.\u00a0\nG: Governance\nGovernance deals with a company\u2019s leadership, executive pay, audits, internal controls, and shareholder rights. Investors want to know if they can trust the company and what kind of decisions are taken behind closed doors. Some factors that could impact an organisation\u2019s Governance score are the makeup of the board of directors, executive compensation guidelines, political contributions and lobbying, and hiring and onboarding best practices.\nWho is looking at ESG scores?\nThe rise of ESG reflects a growing appetite among investors, consumers, employees, and business owners for a more sustainable and ethical way of doing business. The ever-increasing interest in measuring and ranking ESG by firms and investors reflects the perspective that environmental, social, and governance dimensions should be factored in when considering business success.\u00a0\nWhat is ESG reporting software?\nESG software is a powerful tool that allows businesses to enter data, track performance, and generate reports on their non-financial performance. Some data points that could be included in ESG reporting are greenhouse gas emissions, waste production, water usage, governance structure, employee satisfaction, board representation, and diversity, equity and inclusion.\u00a0\nWhat are the benefits of using ESG reporting software?\nESG software enables businesses to pull reports, track their performance, and set targets. ESG software also provides a measure of quality assurance and is an important part of standardising ESG reporting across sectors. Finally, ESG software provides businesses with essential insight and empowers them to make the most effective and data-driven decisions to become more sustainable.\u00a0\nPlan A has streamlined ESG reporting tools\u00a0 to help optimise your business\u2019s performance and get you ahead of the pack on ESG. Plan A\u2019s new ESG template Builder template builder allows you to create and send questionnaires to report ESG-related and non-financial dimensions. As a result, any Sustainability Manager can now cover all internal and external ESG reporting needs, adapting to any framework in a few clicks. Find out more today .\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat are challenges to ESG reporting that businesses should consider?\nInvestors increasingly view ESG scores as essential signifiers of a company's robustness and sustainability. While ESG becomes an increasingly important measure of company performance, there are several caveats and challenges this emerging field must consider. To live up to its promise, ESG will need to increase transparency and accountability in data collection and reporting and scale up knowledge and capacity within businesses.\u00a0\n- Lack of capacity\u00a0\nFirst, there is the question of businesses' capacity and ability to keep up with reporting requirements. Studies have found that many companies are unprepared to gather and report their ESG data. For instance, more than half of businesses are housing their ESG data in spreadsheets instead of using ESG reporting software.\u00a0\n- Lack of data collection standards\nSecond, a lack of clarity around what data needs to be collected and reported makes it difficult to compare scores across and within sectors. \"This is the biggest challenge facing sustainable investing: there is no clear-cut criteria about what makes a company ESG investable,\" explains Dora Blanchet , team leader at the European Securities and Markets Authority. \"That is another reason why we so definitely need the data quality,\". \"As long as you don't have robust methodologies, there is no policing of what is qualifying as ESG investment,\" she added.\u00a0\nThis lack of clarity and transparency around ESG reporting can lead to accusations of greenwashing, which is increasingly a liability for businesses. You can optimise your non-financial reporting with Plan A and report ESG with confidence.\nHow does the EU support standards in ESG reporting?\n\u200d The EU has been ramping up reporting regulations and frameworks to add teeth to ESG reporting, making it much harder for businesses to get away with unsubstantiated and misleading claims about sustainability. For instance, the EU is soon set to tighten ESG disclosure requirements for large businesses.\nAccording to a press release by the European Council, the EU has agreed on plans to mandate large businesses to disclose more information relating to their environmental, social and governance (ESG) plans and performance from January 2024 onwards. Companies will need to disclose the impacts of their activities and supply chains on people and the environment.\u00a0\nThis is fantastic news for consumers and the planet. Greenwashing distracts from the work that needs to be done and gives consumers a false sense of security that their choices are indeed earth-friendly. According to Bruno Le Maire, the new mandate on ESG reporting \u201cis excellent news for all European consumers. They will now be better informed about the impact of business on human rights and the environment.\u201d\u00a0\nThe global economy has a long way to go regarding accountability, but this new mandate is a step in the right direction.\u00a0\nWhat is the future of ESG?\nUnderlying the new focus on ESG reports is the understanding that more factors than financial performance affect a company\u2019s performance and sustainability. Consumers partly drive the increasing importance of ESG, 80% of which \u201c agree that a business must play a role in addressing societal issues; they want a company to take actions which increase profits, improve social conditions, and make the world a better place.\u201d\u00a0\nInvestor preference is also driving the rise of ESG. Indeed, studies have shown that 49% of millennial millionaires make their investments based on social factors.\u00a0\nAnd finally, corporations are interested in optimising ESG performance to stay ahead of regulations and competitors. Studies have found that some 63% of sustainable funds performed in the top half of their respective categories in 2018.\nESG is increasingly the model for non-financial reporting and regulations, such as the EU Taxonomy, the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), and as well as the entity-level disclosure for reporting on the EU's Sustainable Finance Related Disclosure (SFRD).\u00a0\u00a0\nThe rapid rise in ESG reporting requirements has been a challenge for many businesses. A survey of business leaders from the US and UK found that \u201cmore than 90% see ESG issues as a financial imperative but that 79% are unprepared to meet the proposed reporting requirements.\u201d To help our customers meet new reporting requirements, Plan A has an ever-growing template database which includes the NFRD and SFRD.\nIs ESG reporting right for my business?\nHigh ESG performance makes your company more attractive to VCs and other private equity investors.\n- Integrating ESG gives you a clear competitive advantage.\u00a0\n- ESG optimisation allows you to get ahead of the curve and be prepared for upcoming reporting and regulation requirements.\n- ESG reporting gives you clarity on your business\u2019s impact and allows you to avoid greenwashing and the negative PR that can come from it.\u00a0\n- High ESG scores allow you to attract and retain the best talent.\u00a0\n- Business with high ESG performances are more competitive. \u200d\nWe hope this overview of ESG has been helpful and inspired you to either integrate these criteria into your business practices or take your existing ESG practices to a new level.

Accurate carbon accounting gives companies an overview of where they emit and where reduction efforts would have the most significant impact. With the rise of ESG reporting, regulatory and reporting frameworks, and carbon pricing, this important topic is sure to grow in prominence in years to come.\u00a0\nWhat does carbon accounting mean?\nCarbon accounting , or \"greenhouse gas accounting\", refers to the systematic methodologies, measurement, and monitoring used to evaluate and quantify how much carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) an entity or activity emits. Carbon accounting measures emissions of all greenhouse gases and includes CO 2 , methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases. Gases other than carbon are expressed in terms of carbon equivalents.\u00a0\u00a0\nWho uses carbon accounting?\nGovernments, businesses, and individuals can all use carbon accounting to calculate their greenhouse gas emissions. The total greenhouse gas emissions created by a person, country, or company is known as their carbon footprint . Carbon footprints most commonly show a yearly snapshot of an entity\u2019s continuous emissions.\u00a0\nWhy does carbon accounting matter to businesses?\nCarbon accounting is an important factor when determining a business\u2019s environmental impact. It is a crucial indicator for investors, consumers, and employees alike when accessing a company\u2019s non-financial performance.\u00a0\n\u200d\nCarbon accounting is essential for businesses to:\n- Understand their carbon footprint (scope 1, 2 and 3)\n- Identify opportunities for decarbonisation\n- Optimise ESG performance\n- Future-proof their business against the rising cost of carbon and climate risk\n- Align with rapidly changing rules, reporting requirements, and regulations\u00a0\u200d\nWhen did companies begin using carbon accounting?\nCarbon accounting rose in prominence starting in the early 2000\u2019s, together with the concept of a carbon footprint, which was popularised through an advertising campaign by British Petroleum in 2005. Carbon accounting soon became a standard way for businesses to measure their ecological impact. For instance, in 2012, the UK coalition government introduced mandatory carbon reporting, requiring around 1,100 of the UK\u2019s largest listed companies to report their greenhouse gas emissions every year.\nCarbon accounting has since risen in importance as more regulations make disclosures of emissions mandatory. To learn more about policies and regulations, visit our policy centre and download our helpful fact sheets.\u00a0\nThus, there is an upward trend in reporting requirements and regulations that demand companies understand where and how much carbon they emit.\u00a0\nThe most well-known example of non-financial reporting is ESG reporting , which has become a standard for businesses across the globe. ESG frameworks measure a business's non-financial performance in environmental, social and governance categories. Carbon accounting is an essential component of the E, \u2018Environment\u2019, in ESG.\u00a0\nWhat is a carbon equivalent?\nCarbon equivalent is a metric measure used to compare the emissions from various greenhouse gases based on their Global warming potential (GWP). GWP measures the relative potency of different greenhouse gases in trapping heat inside the earth\u2019s atmosphere. For example, methane (CH4) is 28 times stronger than CO2 in trapping heat over a 100-year-period. A carbon equivalent is calculated by converting the GWP of other gases to the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide.\nWhat is the future of carbon accounting?\nAs pressure rises to lower emissions and reach ambitious decarbonisation goals, the role of carbon accounting is increasingly crucial to a business\u2019s success. In addition to climate pledges and regulatory constraints, the price of carbon is steadily rising and this further incentivises the private sector to measure, track and reduce carbon emissions.\nCarbon accounting provides businesses with tools to quantify and measure carbon emissions and allows them to make informed decisions regarding decarbonisation strategies. Carbon accounting allows companies to pinpoint where they are releasing the most emissions. This enables them to prioritise decarbonisation strategies on where they will have the greatest impact.\nIn short: carbon accounting identifies the most powerful levers for decarbonisation. Carbon accounting is the first and critical step to emissions reduction, which is essential if we want to remain below 2 degrees of global warming. It is also important to business\u2019s bottom line as the price of carbon and regulatory risk associated with carbon continues to rise.\u00a0\nIn a great win for our planet, accounting for greenhouse gas emissions is increasingly an industry-standard requirement for businesses. The chart below shows how global interest in carbon management is increasing.\nA clear increase of global search interest for Carbon Management\nCredit: Plan\u00a0A\nWhat does carbon accounting have to do with the Paris Climate Agreement? \u200d\n\u200d The Paris Climate Agreement is an international treaty adopted by 196 nations at COP21 in Paris in 2015 and came into force a year later in 2016. Most broadly, it aims to limit global warming to \"well below 2\u00b0C, and preferably below 1.5\u00b0C.\u201d The Paris Agreement has requested participating countries to formulate actions they plan to take to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The commitments are known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Within the agreement, countries developed an enhanced transparency framework (ETF) to report transparently and track progress on the actions taken.\u00a0\nCarbon accounting is an important tool countries use to measure their emissions reductions and compare them to the emission reduction targets set out in the Paris Agreement. Unfortunately, as of today, the world is not on track to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.\u00a0\nWhat are the different carbon accounting methods?\nThe GHG Protocol\u2019s Corporate Standard and Corporate Value Chain Standard ensure accurate and fair accounts of a company\u2019s carbon footprint through agreed-upon methodologies and accounting principles. Carbon accounting and reporting should follow five main principles: relevance, completeness, consistency, transparency and accuracy. You can read more of these Principles on page 7 of the GHG Protocol\u2019s Corporate Standard .\u00a0\nThe standards describe various carbon accounting methods that can be selected based on data availability, materiality and accuracy. Below you can read about five important methods: the physical-unit method, spend-based method, supplier-specific method, average method, and hybrid method.\nPhysical-unit method: Together with \u201cspend-based\u201d, physical-unit describes the type of activity data used. It calculates GHG emissions based on the number of physical units a company consumes or uses (e.g. electricity in kWh, gasoline consumed in litres).\nSpend-based method: Together with \u201cphysical-based\u201d, spend-based describes the type of activity data used. It calculates GHG emissions based on the financial value of a purchased good or service (e.g. total value in euros paid for IT hardware), then multiplies it by a relevant emissions factor (the amount of GHG emissions produced per monetary unit).\nSupplier-specific method: Collects product-level cradle-to-gate GHG inventory data (i.e. emission factors) from goods or services Suppliers of the reporting company. This is the most accurate but also the most time and resource-intensive method. \u200d\nAverage-data method: Estimates emissions by collecting data on the mass or other relevant units for the emissions category, and multiplies this by the relevant secondary (e.g. industry average) emission factors (e.g. average emissions per unit of good or service).\n\u200d\nHybrid-method: A combination of supplier-specific activity (if available) and using secondary data to fill the gaps. It can also mean the mixed use of physical- and spend-based methods.\nWhich of these carbon accounting methods is right for your company? Find a detailed comparison of the different methods on our Academy .\nWhat are scopes 1, 2 and 3?\nAccording to the leading GHG Protocol Corporate Standard, a company's greenhouse gas emissions are classified into three scopes. While some standards and regulatory requirements, such as TCFD, EU NFRD and UK SECR, already require the disclosure of a company's scope 1 and 2 emissions, the reporting of scope 3 emissions is mostly voluntary. However, upcoming regulations, such as the EU CSRD or the already partly implemented EU SFDR, will also require the disclosure of scope 3 emissions.\u00a0\nScope 1 emissions are direct emissions from company-owned and controlled resources. In other words, emissions are released into the atmosphere as a direct result of a set of activities at a company level. Scope 1 has four categories: stationary combustion, mobile combustion, fugitive emissions, and process emissions.\u00a0\nScope 2 emissions are indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy, from a utility provider. In other words, all GHG emissions released in the atmosphere, from the consumption of purchased electricity, steam, heat and cooling.\nScope 3 emissions are all indirect emissions - not included in scope 2 - that occur in the value chain of the reporting company, both upstream and downstream.\nScope 3 describes activities and emissions in the value chain that are outside the company\u2019s direct control and, therefore, the hardest to measure and reduce. However, companies succeeding in reporting all three scopes will gain a competitive advantage through early alignment with compliance, decarbonisation, and reduced climate risk, among other benefits. Plan A covers the three scopes in detail in our Academy .\u00a0\nWhy is scope 3 so important?\nFor most industries, 92% of a company's emissions come from scope 3 (indirect emissions) - meaning that only 8% of GHG emissions come from scopes 1 and 2 of emissions . For companies to reduce their emissions, they must also set their efforts on scope 3. Therefore, allocating resources for scope 3 carbon accounting and decarbonisation is a tremendous opportunity for companies to create a real impact and drastically reduce their carbon footprint.\u00a0\nWhat is a carbon accounting software?\nCarbon accounting software allows companies to streamline and automate their carbon accounting. For instance, Plan A\u2019s platform has a series of scope 1, 2 and 3 calculators to streamline businesses\u2019 carbon accounting and lay the groundwork for setting SBTi targets.\nIt is essential that carbon accounting tracks emissions across the full supply chain of a business, as often the vast majority of greenhouse gas emissions are found in scope 3.\nTo address this need, Plan A's new Suppliers Module allows companies to track, report and reduce emissions beyond scopes 1 and 2 by providing a complete overview of scope 3 supplier emissions.\u00a0\nCarbon accounting softwares can also automate and streamline compliance with non-financial regulatory and reporting frameworks. The Plan A\u00a0platform's customisable reports allow for streamlined compliance with NFRD, SFRD and other ESG reporting requirements.\nHow can my business use carbon accounting?\nCarbon accounting is essential to a company\u2019s current and future success. Establishing a credible decarbonisation strategy is key to:\n- Lowering financial risk\n- Protecting your business against rising cost of carbon\n- Avoiding greenwashing allegations\n- Complying with a rapidly changing regulatory landscape\nHow can my business measure and reduce emissions with Plan A?\n\u200d Science-driven analysis and decision-making are at the heart of any decarbonisation strategy, which is why Plan A has a highly specialised carbon accounting team, a Scientific Board, and is T\u00dcV Rheinland Certified.\nPlan A\u2019s decarbonisation and ESG management platform follows the methodology of the internationally recognised Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Standard . The software collects the necessary company data across all relevant emissions scopes (scopes 1, 2, and 3) to the industry and merges them with the appropriate emission factors. The application then derives emissions estimates and monitors them over time to visualise progress.\nPlan A believes that it is not enough to create visibility for a company\u2019s current carbon footprint. Instead, our software actively helps companies set Paris Agreement-compliant net-zero targets and achieve them through decarbonisation solutions and activities, as well as a network of service providers and sustainability professionals. These are based on the company\u2019s emissions profile and directly address the indicators with the most significant reduction potential.\nIf your business is ready to become a leader in sustainability and begin your path to net-zero, sign up for a free demo with Plan A today.

It is calculated as a combination of various types of pollution. Different nations have their own AQIs corresponding to other air quality standards.\nLearn more\nSource:\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service\nAir pollution\nAir pollution is the contamination of the environment by any physical, chemical, or biological agent that changes the natural characteristics of the atmosphere. Air pollution, and its impact on air quality, are closely linked to our climate and ecosystems.\nMany drivers of air pollution, such as burning fossil fuels, are also sources of carbon emissions.\nLearn more\nSource:\nWorld Health Organisation\nAtmosphere / Air\nThe atmosphere is the layer of gases that envelopes a planet. Surprisingly, oxygen isn't the most abundant gas in our planet's atmosphere.

Both compensation and neutralisation can be considered BVCM, and should always come as an addition to decarbonisation, rather than its substitute.\nLearn more\nNet-zero journey, explained\nSource:\nBiofuel\nBiofuels are fuels derived from biological sources. These include but are not limited to crops, new and used vegetable oils, animal fats, and various forms of waste. Biofuels can complement or replace traditional fossil fuels, although different biofuels' greenhouse gas mitigation potential may vary considerably.\nLearn more\nSource:\nOffice of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy\nBiomass / Biogas\nAccording to the European Union's Renewable Energy Directive, biomass is the biodegradable part of waste, products, and residues from different industries such as agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and aquaculture.\nBiomass can be converted into electricity, burned to create heat, or processed into biofuels. Since biomass is a fuel type, some people use the terms biomass and biofuel interchangeably. Biomass is a renewable organic material.\nPlant-, wood-, and other bio-waste are the most common types of biomass used for energy. Biomass is a solid material which can be converted to biogas (main methane) with the use of microorganisms in the absence of oxygen (a.k.a. Anaerobic Digestion).\nLearn more\nSource:\nEuropean Union\nCarbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)\nThe Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is a system that places a carbon price on imports of products from countries with less ambitious national policies around climate change. The system is designed to prevent the risk of carbon leakage and was proposed by the European Commission in 2021.\nIt is currently being legislated as part of the European Green Deal and is expected to take effect in 2026, with reporting starting in 2023.\nLearn more\nSource:\nEuropean Commission\nCarbon Insetting\nCarbon insetting is a strategy used by companies to reduce their emissions and carbon footprint within their supply chain or industry. This approach involves investing in nature-based solutions such as reforestation, agroforestry, renewable energy, and regenerative agriculture. These solutions are aimed not only at sequestering carbon but also at creating positive impacts for communities, landscapes, and ecosystems associated with the company's value chain.\nLearn more\nSource:\nCarbon accounting\nCarbon accounting , or \"greenhouse gas accounting\", refers to the systematic methodologies, measurement, and monitoring used to evaluate and quantify how much carbon dioxide equivalents (CO 2 e) an entity or activity emits. Carbon accounting measures emissions of all greenhouse gases and includes CO 2 , methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases. Gases other than carbon are expressed in terms of carbon equivalents.\u00a0\u00a0\nLearn more\nSource:\nGreenhouse Gas Balances of Bioenergy Systems\nCarbon budget\nThe carbon budget is the amount of greenhouse gases that humanity can emit into the atmosphere by the end of this century and still limit the global temperature increase compared to the pre-industrial levels (1850-1900). According to the IPCC, the atmosphere can absorb, calculated from the beginning of 2020, no more than 400 gigatonnes (Gt) of CO 2 if we are to stay below the 1.5\u00b0C thresholds.\u00a0\nAnnual emissions of CO 2 \u2013 from burning fossil fuels, industrial processes and land-use change \u2013 are estimated to be 42.2 Gt per year, the equivalent of 1,337 tonnes per second. At current emissions rates, the budget for staying below the 2\u00b0C thresholds would be exhausted in about 25 years. The concept of the carbon budget is based on an almost linear relationship between cumulative emissions and temperature rise. Nevertheless, this does not mean that the Earth would be 1.5\u2070C warmer precisely when the remaining carbon budget for staying below the 1.5\u2070C threshold is exhausted.\nLearn more\nThe carbon bubble \u2013 towards a new financial crisis?\nSource:\nMCC Berlin\nCarbon capture and storage (CCS)\nCarbon capture is the process of capturing carbon dioxide from chemical or biomass power plants and storing it underground to prevent the release of carbon dioxide. Carbon capture technologies range from forestry to air-filtering machinery capable of capturing airborne CO 2 . Innovative compensation efforts often include carbon capture and storage mechanisms.\nLearn more\nSource:\nCarbon credit\nThe carbon credit system provides an incentive to reduce the emissions of one's own company. First, a company sets an emission cap, which is then reduced periodically. If a company exceeds this limit, it will receive a fine. Unused certificates can be sold to other companies. The certificates provide a market-oriented mechanism for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The number of overall available credits is reduced over time to reduce global greenhouse gases.\nLearn more\nSource:\nInvestopedia\nCarbon dioxide (CO2)\nCarbon dioxide (or CO 2 ) is a colourless, odourless gas consisting of one part carbon and two parts oxygen. CO 2 is a natural component of our planet's atmosphere and is one of the most common greenhouse gases. It is released through human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, but also by natural processes.\nBecause humanity releases more carbon dioxide \u2013primarily through burning fossil fuels like coal and oil\u2013 into the atmosphere than current biological processes can remove, the amount and concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and ocean increases yearly.\nThere are other greenhouse gases beyond carbon dioxide, such as methane (CH 4 ), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), or fluorinated gases (F-gases).\nLearn more\nSource:\nUniversity Corporation for Atmospheric Research\nCarbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e)\nCarbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 e) is a single unit metric used to harmonise emissions from many different greenhouse gases based on their Global Warming Potential (GWP). In greenhouse gas accounting, CO 2 e is more accurate than CO 2 alone because it covers the GWPs of all greenhouse gases that capture heat and warm our planet's atmosphere. For example, in a 100-year-period, methane traps 28 times more heat than CO 2 , giving it a GWP of 28 CO 2 e.\nLearn more\nSource:\nEurostat\nCarbon emissions\nCarbon emissions \u2013also known as greenhouse gas emissions\u2013 release carbon into the atmosphere.

This relocation can cause the company's carbon footprint to rise due to a more extensive licence to pollute and the environmental costs of transportation. In addition, relocating to less regulated countries often results in inaccurate carbon measurement and skews the carbon emissions mapping and attribution. The risk of carbon leakage may be higher in energy-intensive industries.\nLearn more\nSource:\nCarbon market\nA carbon market is a voluntary or legally operated system to enable the trade of carbon credits between private and public entities.\nThe first carbon market was defined by the Kyoto Protocol which created three market mechanisms to achieve these emissions reductions: the International Emissions Trading (IET), the Joint Implementation, and the Clean Development Mechanism (see Clean Development Mechanism).\nThe goal of a carbon market is to create an economic incentive for companies to reduce their emissions, as they can sell any unused emissions allowances to other companies that need them. Carbon markets can take many forms, such as cap-and-trade systems or carbon taxes, but the basic principle is the same: to use the power of the market to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change.\nThe carbon market's goal is to create a carbon price and transform carbon into a valuable commodity, incentivising emitters to use this resource cautiously and even as a revenue generating activity in some cases.\nLearn more\nSource:\nUNFCCC\nCarbon negative\nCarbon negative is achieved when an organisation's activities go beyond achieving net-zero carbon emissions to create an environmental benefit by removing additional carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\nLearn more\nWhat is the difference between carbon-neutral, net-zero and climate positive?\nSource:\nCarbon neutrality / carbon-neutral\nCarbon neutrality means that any CO 2 released into the atmosphere from a company's activities are balanced by the equivalent amount being compensated or removed. Companies can achieve carbon neutrality by buying carbon credits to offset their emissions. Plan A aims to take companies to net-zero rather than carbon neutrality as it embeds the notion of decarbonisation into the process.\nLearn more\nWhat is the difference between carbon-neutral, net-zero and climate positive?\nSource:\nEuropean Parliament\nCarbon positive\nCarbon positive, or climate positive, is a term often used by companies to announce that they have moved beyond carbon neutrality by reducing/removing more greenhouse gas emissions than they are generating.\nLearn more\nWhat is the difference between carbon-neutral, net-zero and climate positive?\nSource:\nClean Development Mechanism (CDM)\nThe Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is a UN initiative that allows emission reduction projects in developing countries to earn certified emission reduction (CER) credits. Each of these credits is equivalent to one tonne of CO 2 e. These certified emission reduction credits can be traded, bought, and sold. Industrialised countries use them to help meet their emission compensation targets under the Kyoto Protocol.\nLearn more\nSource:\nUNFCC\nClimate\nClimate describes the average weather in a specific geographical region over a period of time. This period, the so-called standard period, generally lasts for 30 years. If the statistical mean values for temperature, wind, or rain change over a more extended period (decades or longer), it demonstrates climate change.\nLearn more\nSource:\nClimateurope\nClimate change\nAccording to the United Nations, climate change refers to the shifts in temperature and weather patterns over an extended period.\nSome of these shifts may be natural, although, since 1800, human activities have been the main driver of climate change \u2013 primarily through burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas, which adds greenhouse gases to the atmosphere and oceans above what a natural cycle can cope with. This, in turn, causes shifts and accelerated changes in the local and global climates.\nAs emissions continue to rise, our planet is now 1.1\u00b0C warmer than it was in the late 1800s on average. Although climate change is equated to warmer temperatures, its consequences go beyond temperatures. Examples of climate change effects are intense droughts, water scarcity, severe fires, flooding, storms, and a decline in biodiversity.\nLearn more\nThe FAQ of Climate Change\nSource:\nUnited Nations\nCompensation\nCompensation, also known as (carbon) offsetting, is the voluntary or mandatory purchase of carbon credits to balance the emissions caused by an entity. The price for a carbon credit used for compensation is the benchmark when comparing an investment for direct internal reductions.\nSome greenhouse gas emissions are impossible to avoid, and compensation through carbon credits helps to achieve climate neutrality and net-zero objectives. Compensation includes investments in renewables, energy efficiency, reforestation, carbon capture, and other highly quantifiable carbon mitigation activities.\nLearn more\nSource:\nUnited Nations\nCorporate Carbon Footprint\nCorporate Carbon Footprint (CCF) represents a reporting company's direct and indirect carbon dioxide equivalent emissions within a defined time period (usually a single year).

Decarbonisation is achieved through cross-cutting measures to reduce or eliminate carbon emissions from an organisation's or individual's activities. Decarbonisation differs from climate neutrality because it seeks to reduce absolute carbon emissions and intensity. Climate neutrality does not necessarily include decarbonisation actions, as climate neutrality can be achieved through solely buying carbon credits.\nLearn more\nWhat does decarbonisation mean for companies?\nSource:\nDirect emissions\nDirect (greenhouse gas) emissions are produced from sources owned, produced, and controlled by a company. They are referred to as \"Scope 1 emissions\" in the context of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.\nThe difference between direct and indirect emissions is that indirect (greenhouse gas) emissions are a consequence of the activities of the reporting organisation but are controlled or produced by another company, for instance, a cloud storage provider or a taxi ride.\nLearn more\nWhat are Scopes 1, 2 and 3 of Carbon Emissions?\nSource:\nIndia GHG Program\nEU Taxonomy\nThe EU Taxonomy is a classification that sets criteria to determine whether an economic activity significantly contributes to the six environmental objectives as defined in the regulation:\nThe Taxonomy Regulation establishes six environmental objectives, directly related to sustainability principles:\n1. Climate change mitigation\n2. Climate change adaptation\n3. The sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\n4. The transition to a circular economy\n5. Pollution prevention and control\n6. The protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\nThe objective of this regulation is to provide a common framework to assess the sustainability of economic activities. As such, large companies and financial market participants are now required to disclose the environmental impact of their capital spending against these pillars to allow consumers and government to integrate non-financial performance into their buying decisions.\nLearn more\nGuide to the EU Taxonomy\nSource:\nEuropean Union\nEmissions\nEmissions (to air) are defined as all of the gases and substances released into the atmosphere. Since the industrialisation era, human activities have significantly altered the chemical composition of our atmosphere through the release of substances and greenhouse gases.\nLearn more\nSource:\nUnited States Environmental Protection Agency\nEmissions trading\nEmissions trading, also known as cap-and-trade, is a market-based system for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Under an emissions trading system, a government sets a limit or \"cap\" on the total amount of emissions that can be produced by a particular sector or region. This cap is then divided into a certain number of allowances, each of which represents the right to emit a certain amount of greenhouse gases. These allowances can be bought and sold on a market, allowing companies that can reduce their emissions at a lower cost to sell their excess allowances to companies that find it more expensive to reduce their emissions.\nThe goal of emissions trading is to create an economic incentive for companies to reduce their emissions, as they can sell any unused emissions allowances to other companies that need them. This allows for the most cost-effective emissions reductions to take place, as companies will naturally reduce their emissions where it is cheapest to do so. Emissions trading systems can be used to regulate emissions from specific sectors, such as power plants or factories, or from an entire country or region.\nLearn more\nSource:\nEuropean Union\nEnvironment, Social, Governance (ESG)\nESG is an acronym that stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance. It is a framework used to measure a business's non-financial performance in environmental, social and governance categories. It is used as a basis for various regulations such as the NFRD, CSRD and the SFDR.\nThe growing interest in measuring and ranking ESG by investors and businesses reflects the perspective that environmental, social, and governance dimensions should be factored in when considering business success.\nEnvironmental factors include company policies around climate change, such as their decarbonisation action, natural resources, pollution and waste, and other factors.\nSocial criteria include human rights, labour standards across the supply chain, integration to local communities, and other social dimensions.\nGovernance includes business ethics, compliance, accurate accounting methods, salaries, structure for shareholders, and whether or not a company pursues integrity and diversity when selecting its leadership.\nLearn more\nWhy is ESG important for companies and investors?\nSource:\nFossil fuels\nFossil fuels are materials formed naturally in the Earth's crust from the remains of dead plants and animals over millennia. They are extracted and used chiefly for fuelling purposes.\nAccording to the United Nations, over 80% of the CO 2 generated by humans comes from burning fossil fuels. Their extraction, combustion and consequent emissions-to-air negatively affect the carbon cycle, which in balanced states allows for climate stability and a functioning biosphere. Fossil fuels include but are not limited to petroleum, coal, and natural gas.\nLearn more\nThe carbon bubble \u2013 towards a new financial crisis?\nSource:\nScienceDaily\nGlobal Surface Temperature\nIn earth science, the global surface temperature is calculated by averaging the temperature at the surface of the sea and air temperature over land. In technical writing, scientists call long-term changes in GST global cooling or global warming. Periods of both have happened regularly throughout earth's history. The global average temperature has warmed by 1.09\u00b0C (range: 0.95 to 1.20\u00b0C) from 1850\u20131900 to 2011\u20132020.\nLearn more\nSource:\nScience Direct\nGlobal Warming Potential (GWP)\nAll greenhouse gases have different chemical compositions and properties, leading to different strengths and timescales contributing to the greenhouse effect.\nThe Global Warming Potential (GWP) index is used to measure the relative warming effects of these gases, using CO 2 as the baseline. To calculate the relative impact of these gases, the Global Warming Potential (GWP) index is used, using CO 2 as the baseline and harmonising all gases as carbon dioxide equivalents.\nDue to the different lifetime effects of other gases (e.g. methane dissipates more quickly than carbon dioxide), choosing the appropriate time horizon is crucial. As recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the time horizon of 100 years is used across the Plan A Sustainability Platform.\nLearn more\nSource:\nGlobal warming\nGlobal warming is the long-term heating of Earth's surface observed since the pre-industrial period (between 1850 and 1900) due to human activities, primarily fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in the Earth's atmosphere. Climate change includes both warming and side effects of warming, such as melting glaciers and more frequent droughts.\nLearn more\nSource:\nGreen bonds\nGreen bonds are issued to raise financing for sustainability or climate related investments. These bonds are similar to traditional bonds in that they pay interest to investors, but the proceeds from the sale of green bonds are specifically earmarked for projects that have a positive environmental impact.\nGreen bonds are typically issued with the same credit rating as the issuer's traditional bonds, and the maturity, coupon, and other terms are similar to those of other bonds. However, they may have additional features, such as a use of proceeds, to ensure that the funds are used for a specific environmental project. Green bonds are also subject to independent review and certification to ensure that the proceeds are being used for eligible green projects.\nThe demand for green bonds has been growing in recent years as investors become more interested in environmentally friendly investments. Green bonds help to finance renewable energy, energy efficiency, sustainable transportation and water treatment plants, among others. They also help to raise awareness and encourage investment in environmental projects and it is a way to align financial markets with the Paris Agreement goals.\nNote: The World Bank has issued over 150 green bonds since 2008, with a combined value of almost $15 billion.\nLearn more\nSource:\nGreenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol\nThe Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol) is a globally recognised standard for measuring and managing greenhouse gas emissions. The GHG Protocol was established in 1990 out of the need for a consistent framework for greenhouse gas reporting. Today, it collaborates with governments, industry associations, NGOs, corporations and other organisations to provide the world's most widely used emission calculation guidelines.\nCountries and companies committed to the Paris Agreement must reduce their GHG emissions. They must account for, report, and mitigate emissions by following standards such as the GHG Protocol. The GHG Protocol has enabled decarbonisation across operations in the public and private sectors by providing a unified framework for emission management. Plan A's Sustainability Platform follows the GHG Protocol.\nLearn more\nWhat are Scopes 1, 2 and 3 of Carbon Emissions?\nSource:\nWRI\nGreenhouse effect\nThe greenhouse effect occurs when greenhouse gases (GHGs) accumulate in the Earth's atmosphere. These naturally occurring gases include carbon dioxide (CO\u2082), methane (CH 4 ), nitrogen oxide (N 2 O), and fluorinated gases (HFCs), chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).\nGreenhouse gases trap the sun's heat as it reflects from the Earth's surface. This process warms the planet and leads to rising global temperatures. Without the natural greenhouse effect, the global mean temperature would be -18\u00b0C and therefore uninhabitable for humans. Humans amplify the natural greenhouse effect by releasing greenhouse gases when burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas.\nLearn more\nSource:\nCambridge\nGreenhouse gases (GHGs)\nGreenhouse gases (GHGs) are gases in the atmosphere that contribute to the greenhouse effect and warm the planet.\nCarbon dioxide (CO 2 ), ozone (O 3 ), methane (CH 4 ), and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) are the significant gases driving the atmospheric temperature increase. According to the IPCC report, an estimated 59 billion tonnes of GHG were emitted in 2019, with a large part being carbon dioxide.\nLearn more\nHave you heard of the most powerful Greenhouse Gas we know?\nSource:\nHydrogen\nHydrogen is the most abundant element that exists in the universe.

In 2019, Ganni became a signatory of the UN Fashion Charter for Climate Action, having set a 30% reduction in CO2 emissions per kg of clothing goal in line with UNFCCC Race to zero by 2050.\nBut now Ganni wants to take the next step, undertaking a more granular understanding of their emissions and setting up an ambitious carbon strategy to become the most sustainable fashion provider by 2025, with aggressive reduction targets as well.\n\u201cAs we continue our responsibility journey, we\u2019re learning that fully understanding our impact is key in reducing it. To be able to measure our progress towards reduction targets accurately, we realised we have to step up our carbon mapping efforts and invest in further understanding our CO2 footprint.\u201d\nLauren Bartley\nHead of Sustainability\nSolution\nA comprehensive investigation into Ganni\u2019s corporate carbon footprint\nUsing GANNI A/S internal data and following the GHG protocol methodology, \u00a0Plan A calculated Ganni\u2019s entire corporate carbon footprint, with a specific drill down into purchased materials and their emission intensity. These numbers were used in the creation of Ganni\u2019s annual sustainability report, as well as adjusted for Ganni\u2019s annual reporting into the CDP database. \u00a0\nOnce Ganni had measured and reported on their emissions, Plan A worked with Ganni to set absolute reduction targets and define the pathways to achieve them. The first approach automatically calculated pathways in line with SBTi to achieve a significant reduction of absolute emissions by 2030. The second approach included a review of Ganni\u2019s proposed insetting strategy so that Ganni can take the next step and embed sustainability into their suppliers as well as across their value chain. \u00a0\nThroughout this process, Plan A has provided ongoing consultancy and engagement services, preparing materials for Ganni\u2019s management and advisory board.\nReSults\nGanni has already shown substantial progress in being a sustainability leader in the fashion industry, having achieved a 44% reduction in material emissions between 2019 and 2020. \u00a0Now, Ganni is ready to take the next step; working with Plan A over the next three years. Plan A is fully automating Ganni\u2019s data input, emissions calculations, and external reporting on the Plan A platform, allowing for flexible emissions calculations in line with quarterly reporting and communication.\n\u2028In addition, Plan A is working with Ganni to embed industry-leading sustainability across their value chain by 2025. \u00a0Not content to merely being a signatory to the UN Fashion Charter, Ganni A/S want\u2019s to be a leader in their industry.\nExplore more stories\nPortfolio\nDecarbonising online payment systems with Mollie\nPortfolio\nAligning company growth to sustainability with Payhawk\nPortfolio\nDecarbonising events with MEETYOO\nPortfolio\nWeb 3.0 emissions management and decarbonisation with Sorare\nPortfolio\nSustainability strategy and portfolio engagement as a venture capital firm\nPortfolio\nSetting science-based targets to reach net-zero emissions in the venture building sector\nPortfolio\nCarbon accounting to reduce the institution\u2019s environmental footprint\nInterested in learning more?\nGet in touch with our team to begin your decarbonisation journey\nGet in touch", "source": "https://plana.earth/case-study/ganni", "metadata": {"title": "GANNI Business case for sustainable fashion"}}

Setting company-wide decarbonisation targets is a rather complex step that requires gaining a deep understanding of the different decarbonisation pathways and reduction levers one can set.\nPlan A helps you set science-based decarbonisation targets with the support of a team of leading carbon accounting experts.\nOUR SOLUTION\nSet science-based targets and reach net-zero\n01\nChoose your target setting approach and understand what you would need to achieve different reduction targets in line with the \u2018Science-Based Target Setting initiative (SBTi)\u2019.\n02\nChoose your decarbonisation targets at various scales: company-wide, geography and facility-wide.\n03\nSelect and manage climate actions (a.k.a. action cards) according to your needs. Visualise an estimation of the emission reductions that each action card can promote.\nScore higher on ESG reporting\nCompanies that do have net-zero targets scored better on emissions and disclosure criteria if they also have interim goals before 2040.\nImprove brand reputation\nConsumers are more aware than ever of the effects their choices have on the environment, and are more critical and unsupportive toward companies who are not taking climate action. Indeed, 79% of corporate executives surveyed by SBTi found a strengthened brand reputation to be one of the most significant business benefits experienced after publicly setting science-based targets.\nTarget setting drives innovation\nDecarbonisation target setting encourages innovation as it allows a complete disruption of a company's operations to reduce emissions. Deloitte has analysed the relationship between sustainability and innovation and found that sustainability leaders are more than 400% more likely to be considered \u201cinnovation leaders\u201d than their counterparts.\nIncrease customer loyalty\nDemonstrating concrete sustainability commitments to increasingly-conscious consumers is a sure way to show your consumers that you are serious about building a sustainable future. In fact, The Capgemini Report found that 77% of consumer products and retail organisations found that sustainability leads to increases in customer loyalty.\nTalent retention\nImprove employee engagement, and help in the recruiting and retention of qualified employees.

Our certified methodology means you can explore your data and make informed decisions with confidence.\nStart calculating emissions\nIntroduction\nYour carbon footprint is the prerequisite to your sustainability journey\nCalculating your corporate carbon footprint is defined by measuring all relevant emissions across scopes 1, 2 and 3. This step is crucial, as this analysis will define the baseline year that you will compare all your reduction efforts to.\nBringing awareness to the total corporate carbon footprint and value chain emissions of a business enables all efforts of energy savings, cost savings, and overall environmental impact reductions to commence.

Our carbon accounting methodology is certified by T\u00dcV Rheinland, and is compliant with the GHG protocol.\n02\nCompare emissions across all scopes and facilities, obtain benchmarks for your industry, and identify emissions hotspots you can immediately take action against.\n03\nCustomise and tailor the emissions dashboard to suit your business needs and focus areas.\nComply with regulations\nCalculating your carbon emissions, on all relevant scopes, enables you to prepare for current and future regulations that otherwise may inflict a negative financial impact on your company and its value chain.\nManage climate risk and increase resilience\nInaction on climate change could cost the world\u2019s economy US$178 trillion by 2070. Climate risk poses significant challenges to businesses across all sectors, emphasising the urgent need for proactive measures to mitigate these risks and build resilience in the face of a rapidly changing climate.\nLess CO 2 = fewer costs\nIdentifying and quantifying CO 2 emissions helps to recognise inefficiencies and financial blind spots. Lowering GHG emissions typically goes hand in hand with increasing efficiency and cost-effectiveness in a company's process.\nAccess the carbon market\nMore and more companies have to pay a price for every tonne of CO 2 they emit. This is the so-called carbon trading system. More carbon pricing initiatives are emerging, prices for GHG emissions are on the rise and the private sector is implementing internal carbon pricing systems of its own.\nCalculate your emissions across all scopes\nGet in touch with our team\nBook a demo\nCAse studies\nExplore our customer stories\nFashion\nHelping Ganni make good on their sustainability goals\nRead case study\nEducation\nCarbon accounting to reduce ESMT Berlin's environmental footprint\nRead case study\nVenture Capital\nSustainability strategy and portfolio engagement as a venture capital firm\nRead case study\nDecarbonisation Journey\n01 Collect\n02 Measure\n03 Report\n04 Targets\n05 Reduce\n06 Improve", "source": "https://plana.earth/measure-emissions", "metadata": {"title": "Calculate your company\u2019s carbon footprint | Plan A"}}
